       "Two aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine – The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important.\n",
       "TKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour\n",
       "It is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation.\n",
       "TKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour)\n",
       "Where, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift.\n",
       "Assessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory.\n",
       "More is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must.\n",
       "Actions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL’s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle’s Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition.\n",
       "Tyre Pressure\n",
       "Proper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources.\n",
       "Expected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime.\n",
       "Tyre Performance Analysis\n",
       "Apart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres.\n",
       "Such analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.</div>\n",

It poses the problem of regular maintenance. It has also been observed that defects remain unattended for long due to not being identified. It creates a genuine problem for the visitors' experience and sometimes they are not aware of the optimum result. Here lines the requirement for an automated defective exhibit identification system.\n",
       "Description:\n",
       "It is a real-life problem in big Museum/ Science Museum/Centres, where there is inadequacy of manpower. Following are the problems in a nutshell that arose due to unnoticed and undiagnosed defects of the exhibits.\n",
       "High Maintenance Needs: Unlike static displays, interactive elements have more moving parts, software, and technology that require regular upkeep to function properly these are considered as \"\"golden parameters of any particular Exhibits\"\". Theses parameters are to be kept functional to keep the exhibits in a running condition.\n",
       "Frustration for Visitors: Encountering a non-functional exhibit can be frustrating for visitors, especially children, who may not understand why it's not working.\n",
       "Missed Learning Opportunities: Broken/ non-functional exhibits prevent visitors from fully engaging with the science concepts they're designed to teach.\n",
       "Because of their complexity, malfunctions might not be immediately obvious to visitors or staff, leading to a broken experience. Also creates a bad impression for that particular gallery and ultimately to the science center or to Science Museums.\n",

       "Milk is perishable product, it requires immediate processing after few hours (2-4Hrs) of production, otherwise, bacterial load increases and milk gets deteriorate. At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is\n",
       "the bacteriological quality of milk assumed to be. This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons.\n",
       "Description: The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions. Take 10 ml milk sample in sterile MBRT test tube. Add 1 ml MBRT dye solution (dye concentration 0.005%). Stopper the tubes with sterilized rubber stopper and carefully place them in a test tube stand dipped in a serological water bath maintained at 37t1oC. Record this time as the beginning of the incubation period. Decolourization is considered complete when only a faint blue ring (about 5mm) persists at the top. However, for processed dairy products, the enumeration of bacterial load is time-consuming and requires different methods.\n",
       "Expected solution: The above mentioned MBRT takes 4 to 6 Hours for completion of the test. Therefore, it is proposed to develop cost effective, rapid and portable method/Machine to deduct microbial load in Raw and Pasteurized Milk as compared to present Methylene blue reduction test (MBRT).Meanwhile, smart packaging tools such as freshness indicators could be a solution for processed dairy products.ln this context, artificial intelligence, machine vision, systems, etc. could be explored.</div>\n",

Animal health is also improved through the use of Al.\n",
       "Description: For Al, the semen is inseminated into the female by placing a portion of it either in a collected or diluted form into the cervix or uterus by mechanical methods at the proper time and under most hygienic conditions. Ensuring the integrity of the cold chain from Semen Production centres to the farmer's destination, where semen is utilized for artificial insemination, is crucial for the effective functioning of the Al delivery\n",

For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985.\n",
       "Description: It is observed that some of the firms with valid URN to be handling any of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemical, divert the same from licit channel and traffic it for manufacturing of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Further, the investigations conducted also reveal that the firms usually create documentation of the movement of precursor to a licit firm for a licit activity and divert the same for illicit activities. Therefore, there is a need for end-to-end tracking of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemicals (controlled substances)\n",

Using this continuous spectral information classification of diverse material of interest can be done accurately. The availability of huge information due to continuous spectral information improves data information content but causing challenges in processing of hyperspectral images. An unsupervised learning mechanism for detection of targets by optimizing Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Image Processing using AI/ML can be used for it.\n",

Before processing of data, data correction methods, to improve interpretation of pixel spectra and better result to analyse data can be done. Different approaches for de-noising to remove noise from data, fusion approach through sharpening or pan sharpening can be implemented. The calibration of data using radiometric and atmospheric correction methods can be implemented to optimize the result. An anomaly detection model based on deep learning with best performance to be implemented to process hyperspectral data which can provide clear identification of anomalies in the data with sufficient spectral clarity. Subsequently, the same can be created as spectral signatures of the objects. A suitable target detection methodology for identifying target of interest is also to be developed. \n",

An essential aspect of the mission's success is not only ensuring access to water but also guaranteering its quality. Residual chlorine/Silver ion levels indicate the efficacy of water disinfection, bacteriological contamination poses significant health risks. Existing methods for testing water quality at the household level often lack reliability, accessibility, and affordability.\n",
       "The main aim of the technology challenge is to develop three distinct personalised testing kits (For measuring Residual chlorine, residual silver ion and/or for Bacteriological contamination) that are cost-effective, easy to use, and could measure both residual chlorine levels and bacteriological contamination at the household level. Thse devices are intented to empower rural communities to conduct their own assessments of water quality, enabling prompt action to ensure safe drinking water.\n",
       "Expected Solutions:\n",
       "i. The device should be portable and accurate in detecting low levels of residual chlorine (As per BIS 10500: 2012, acceptable limit: 0.2 mg/liter), residual silver ions and/or bacteriological contamination (E. coli &amp; Total coliform- As per BIS 10500: 2012, it shall not be detectable in any 100 ml of sample), ensuring reliable results comparable to laboratory-grade equipment.\n",
       "ii. The detected value indicates the level of chlorine/silver ion/bacteria (E.Coli) present in 100 ml water. The output of the test should be in digital mode;\n",
       "iii. The personalized testing kits should be affordable for rural households, easy to carry &amp; use and requiring minimal training for operation by individuals.\n",
       "iv. The personalized testing kits should be robust and able to withstand harsh environmental conditions prevalent in rural India, suhc as temperature fulctuations and humidity.\n",
       "v. Quick turnaround time for obtaining results, allowing households to promptly assess water safety;\n",
       "vi. The personalized testing kits should easy to calibrate;\n",
       "vii. Low operation and maintenance;\n",
       "viii. Ensure compliance with relevant regulatory requirments and standards for water quality testing in India;\n",
       "ix. The personalized testing kits should be charged by lithium (should work for minimum 24 hrs aftr getting fully charged) or another type of battery;\n",
       "x. Poses no risks to users or the environment during operation and disposal.</div>\n",

Due to low levels of water metering in irrigation, it is challenging to control theft from canals and unauthorized ground water extractions. Therefore, ET based technologies can enforce water accounting / auditing and thus enhance Water Use Efficiency (WUE). \n",
       "However, the EOS based ET technology has certain limitations i.e. low accuracy under cloudy conditions and low resolutions. Therefore, the drone-based ET systems can be used to bridge this data gap. \n",
       "Description: The idea is to estimate the actual water consumption by the crops (i.e. AET) in a targeted irrigated command area (ranging from 50 Ha to 5000 Ha) with the help of a drone based system. This system should have a portable drone control module along with an in-built Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&amp;ML) mechanism to work out AET and calibrate against the satellite-based ET inputs. Once integrated with cadastral maps, it should be tailored for individual farm level water control. \n",
       "Expected Solution: A drone fitted with suitable ET sensing system to bridge the data gaps/limitations from Satellite based ET system for calculation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of different crops under survey. The AI&amp;ML algorithm using historical data and satellite based inputs should be able to give various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at farm level like (i) Type of Crop; (ii) Crop monitoring (seeding/sowing/harvest/ disease etc); (iii) Water Auditing/Water Accounting: (iv) Over irrigated vs under irrigated/Ground water use; etc. \n",
       "These KPI's can provide an insight of farmer irrigation decision-making; estimation of irrigation water use; farmer irrigation behavior heuristics and management practices, including the scheduling and efficiency of irrigation decisions. The software model can be polished over time in different irrigation commands to improve the accuracy and reliability of irrigation water use estimation. This will give a complete control of water use and agriculture productivity at field through remote sensing and help in increasing the Groundwater Level in critical unsafe areas.</div>\n",

       "The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind presents significant challenges due to their intermittent nature. This variability can strain the power grid, leading to inefficiencies and reliability issues. Traditional grid infrastructure is not designed to handle these fluctuations effectively, resulting in energy wastage and a reliance on fossil fuel-based backup power. Energy storage systems (ESS) offer a potential solution by storing excess energy generated during peak production periods and releasing it during times of high demand or low generation, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply.\n",
       "\n",
       "Description:\n",
       "The task is to design an innovative and efficient energy storage system to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources and stabilize the grid. This requires addressing several key challenges: high costs, technological limitations, and regulatory barriers. Current ESS technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, pumped hydro storage, and flow batteries, each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Innovative ideas need to be explored to reduce costs, enhance storage capacities, and improve the efficiency and lifespan of these technologies. Additionally, how to navigate and potentially reform regulatory frameworks to support the widespread adoption of ESS may also be explored.\n",
       "\n",
       "Expected Solution:\n",
       "Develop approaches to lower the initial and operational costs of ESS, potentially through new materials, manufacturing processes, or economies of scale. Identify or create advanced ESS technologies that offer higher efficiency, greater storage capacity, and longer operational lifespans. Suggest changes to policies and regulations that facilitate ESS integration, including safety standards, performance metrics, and grid interconnection protocols. Formulate strategies to engage key stakeholders, including policymakers, utility companies, and consumers, to build support for ESS deployment. Design small-scale pilot projects to test and refine their proposed solutions in real-world settings, gathering data to demonstrate effectiveness and scalability.</div>\n",

       "Coal is the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India. It accounts for 55% of the country's energy need. The country's industrial heritage was built upon indigenous coal. Our countries major production of Electricity is achieved through coal fired thermal power plant which is around 3/4th of the total power generation and also the biggest source of Carbon emission. India updated its NDC according to which the target: To reduce emissions intensity of its GDP has been enhanced to 45% by 2030 from 2005 level. India's also creating energy transition pathway to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to reduce the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. However, owning to energy security issue the role of coal cannot be ruled out in immediate future till various storage solution gets mature and become available at affordable cost.\n",
       "\n",
       "Description:\n",
       "Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is a promising technology that can help India meet its energy security and emission reduction goals. CCUS can be retrofitted to existing power and industrial plants, allowing for their continued operation. CCS was acknowledged as a solution for climate mitigation by IPCC. However, IPCC also noted that CCS has the highest cost and lowest possible contribution to net emission reduction in both energy and industry sectors. This problem is having potential opportunity for innovators, researchers and start-ups. In order to meet the 1.5°C goal, IPCC projects the need to have technical geological storage of about 1,000 GtCO2. However, the availability of geological storage is highly location dependent and there are several technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-cultural barriers to implementing CCS, according to IPCC.\n",

The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.\n",
       "Detailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example:\n",
       "60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam\n",
       "40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam\n",
       "30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam.\n",
       "Since January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student’s responses. Also some of the people are misusing the benefits by training or teaching the scribe rather than the child with SLD to write the exam and score good marks.\n",
       "Expected Solutions: To develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing pen and writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.</div>\n",

One of the major reasons for disability among the elderly people is falls. Every year, one-third of community-dwelling older adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall. Falls, defined as “unexpected event[s] in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level,” are responsible for a wide range of negative health outcomes. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults, and the age-adjusted fall death rate (64 deaths per 100,000 older adults) increased by 30%. Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause older adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of falling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect whereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their everyday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and more susceptible to future falls. In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual’s strength, balance, and mobility\n",
       "Description: Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants’ presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more\n",
       "The recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people.\n",
       "Expected Solution:\n",
       "These technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers</div>\n",

Functional body powered upper limb prosthesis can replace the functions of upper limb for ADL activities up to some extent. But in higher level of upper limb amputation, it becomes difficult for the patient to manage ADL activities. The requirement of externally powered prosthesis such as myoelectric prosthesis plays a vital role in this aspect.\n",
       "Description of Problem statement: \n",
       "A myoelectric prosthesis is an externally powered prosthesis which is controlled by muscle contraction (muscle action potential). In market, many variants of myoelectric prostheses are available with various features. The most important feature of these prostheses is the grasping pattern types and also it indicates about movement of different fingers in prosthesis. Because it is expensive, access to these high-end prosthesesbecomes challenging for patients with upper limb amputation living in developing nations like India. Even though few myoelectric prostheses are available in market with less cost, but the features are limited and are not working precisely. \n",
       "Expected Solutions: \n",
       "Experts from different disciplines, such as engineers for creating programs and fabrication of controlling circuits and Prosthetist for fabrication of sockets and fitment of the prostheses are required to design and develop a cost-effective myoelectric prosthesis. Most important feature of the prosthesis is the grasping pattern which is completely dependent on the prosthetic hand. Thus, design and fabrication of prosthetic hand also plays a vital role in the complete working mechanism of the prosthesis. Thus, to get a successful result, it is possible to work collaboratively with experts from different discipline.\n",

These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class.\n",
       "Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately.\n",
       "Detailed Description:\n",
       "Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler’s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis.\n",
       "A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification.\n",
       "Expected Solution:\n",
       "Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird\n",

       "The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand.\n",
       "Description:\n",
       "The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs.\n",
       "Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive.\n",
       "Expected Solution:\n",
       "An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.</div>\n",

       "There are numerous engineering and polytechnic institutes in Rajasthan running under the Department of Technical Education, Government of Rajasthan. Notably, during the admission process, there is a significant increase in enquiries from various groups, including students, their parents, and other stakeholders. These enquiries cover a wide range of queries related to admission process, eligibility criteria, information about different colleges, fee structure, curriculum , scholarship , hostel facilities, previous year's college and branch-specific allotments placement opportunities and many more. \n",
       "Currently, stakeholders have tocontact colleges individually through phone or email, and sometimes even visit the colleges personally. This process is not only cumbersome for the stakeholders but also demanding to pool manpower for the colleges to manage these inquiries. \n",
       "Detailed Description: \n",
       "With the continuous rise in enquiries, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the colleges to respond promptly and effectively using traditional communication methods. To address this issue more efficiently and ensure timely assistance for everyone, there is a \n",
       "pressing need to adopt new technological solutions. One effective approach is to develop an \n",
       "AI-powered chatbot at centralized level that would serve as a virtual assistant, available 24/7 to answer a wide range of questions. By automating responses to common enquiries, the chatbot would significantly enhance the accessibility to important information and allow staff to focus on handling more complex queries and other critical tasks. For example, the chatbot would provide insights into information about various engineering and polytechnic colleges that falls under the jurisdiction of Department of Technical Education, and guide users through the admission processes, explain fee structures, share curriculum updates, provide details about available scholarships, share alumni information, and share information on job placement opportunities etc \n",
       "This will empower the technical education department because of the ease of providing information, help and advice instantly to prospective students, their parents, and all interested parties. The required information provided by all colleges can be integrated with ease in software. \n",
       "Expected Solutions: \n",
       "1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot should rapidly access and provide accurate information from a comprehensive database on topics such as admissions, fees, scholarships, recommendations based on previous years cutoff, minimizing the need for human assistance. Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to support voice based assistance in English languages and can be extended in Hindi and other regional languages ensuring wide accessibility and understanding. \n",
       "2. Enhanced User Experience: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate easily and find information quickly. The interface should be straightforward, accessible on common platform, and capable of understanding natural language, ensuring user-friendliness. \n",
       "3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), the chatbot will reduce the workload on department staff, allowing them to concentrate on more complex and urgent tasks. \n",
       "4. Data Insights: The chatbot will gather valuable data from user interactions, helping the department to identify common concerns and optimize it’s services based on these insights. \n",

       "Gap analysis between C emission and sinks and suggesting pathways to carbon neutrality\n",
       "Expected Solution:\n",
       "A comprehensive software solution that includes:\n",
       "Emission estimation: The app would allow users to input data on various mining activities (e.g., excavation, transportation, equipment usage) and estimate the associated carbon emissions based on establishd emission factors. Estimation of Per Capita emissions of a Mine.\n",
       "Carbon Neutrality Pathways: The app could offer features for simulating different emission reduction strategies like:\n",
       "Clean technologies: Assessing the impact of adopting electric vehicles, methane capture systems, and renewable energy sources for mine operations.\n",
       "Afforestation offsets: Calculating the amount of land required for tree plantation to offset remaining emissions based on state specific afforestation plan and Carbon emission reduction.\n",
       "Other Renewables: explore alternative use of energy to reduce direct electricity consumption.\n",
       "Any other pathways:\n",
       "Carbon Credits: Estimation of potential Carbon credit earned as per present market rates.\n",
       "Data visualization: The app should present results visually, using charts and graphs to track emission trends and the effectiveness of implemented strategies.\n",
       "Scalability: Design the app to accommodate different mine sizes and types (underground vs open-cast).\n",

       "Despite the thrust on energy transition from fossil fuel sector to a cost-competitive renewable energy sector, Coal will remain pivotal to energy security of the nation in near future. India is targeting for 1.5 Bt coal production by 2030 to cater to the burgeoning energy needs of the country. To achieve the target, improved productivity and safety in coal mining is pivotal.\n",
       "Description:\n",
       "The problem statement is divided into two parts: one is Digital shift handover log system and other is safety management plan as per DGMS guidelines.\n",
       "A digital shift handover log system is a valuable tool for streamlining and improving the transition of responsibilities and information from one shift to the next within an organization.\n",
       "The problem statement envisages that an app based and web based Shift handover log system be developed as per the Statutory and non-statutory log format currently in practice, which is presently being done manually through paper logs. This will ensure sharing of critical information and briefing of the next shift digitally. It will provide supervisors and operators with an immediate, comprehensive overview of the outgoing shift’s activities.\n",
       "Manual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life.\n",
       "Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same.\n",
       "This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine.\n",
       "Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. \n",
       "Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. \n",
       "Possible Solution:\n",
       "An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines.\n",
       "Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.</div>\n",

       "Visitors to museums often face several significant challenges due to manual ticket booking systems. One prominent issue is the inefficiency and time consumption associated with the process. Long queues are common, especially during peak hours, weekends, or special exhibitions, leading to frustration and impatience among visitors. Besides the wait times, the manual system is prone to errors, such as incorrect ticket issuance, double bookings, or lost records, which can cause further delays and inconvenience. Overall, these challenges associated with manual ticket booking systems significantly detract from the visitor experience, reducing satisfaction and potentially impacting the museum's reputation and visitor numbers.\n",

       "Many organization are using Cloud for hosting their web applications. The attackers can try to attack these webservers for achieving Denial of Service attack. Specifically, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network of Cloud infrastructure by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems assources of attack traffic.\n",
       "Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate security tools to counter and protect against these attacks.\n",
       "\n",
       "• Description:\n",
       "The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further\n",
       "investigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS.\n",
       "Following are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack:\n",
       "1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range\n",
       "2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version\n",
       "3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint\n",
       "4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)\n",
       "There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also.\n",
       "For the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made:\n",
       "1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users.\n",
       "2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability).\n",
       "3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS).\n",
       "4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver.\n",
       "5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure.\n",
       "A solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack.\n",
       "\n",
       "Expected Solution:\n",
       "A set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools\n",
       "should be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack.

Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. \n",
       "Detailed description: \n",
       "The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. \n",
       "To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.\n",

       "Expected solution: Automated oil spill detection system for early detection of oil spills\n",
       "A software/tool/system to be developed for detecting oil spills/vessel in distress with suitable methodology that involves programming in python. The tool/system should detect the anomalies in AIS around the vessel. The distress/anomaly zone has to be monitored for oil spills using Satellite datasets. This can help in early detection of oil leak from a ship or vessel. The information can be passed on to the regulatory authorities for quicker and efficient response.</div>\n",

       "INCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis.\n",
       "Detailed Description:\n",
       "Considering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. \n",
       "Data input, classification and arrangement \n",
       "The software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight.\n",
       "Users, Data output and visualization\n",
       "The users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth.\n",
       "-In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence.\n",
       "Data Accessibility\n",
       "The Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data.\n",
       "Expected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.</div>\n",

Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry.\n",
       "Description: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship’s motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters.

However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes.\n",
       "Description: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields.\n",
       "The DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ.\n",
       "If a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes.\n",
       "This system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency.\n",
       "Expected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy. This system has to be applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, government agencies, and more.</div>\n",

It was also accepted that these SDGs are not possible to achieve without changing humanity’s relationship with the oceans. To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/).\n",

       "Description: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html.\n",
       "\n",
       "Expected Solution:\n",
       "The user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly.\n",

In India, many students and their families are unaware of the diverse career opportunities available, often leading to choices based on limited information or societal pressure. Effective career counselling and guidance are essential for helping students make informed decisions about their futures and aligning their education with their career aspirations. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the need for holistic education, which includes providing students with the guidance necessary to make informed career choices.\n",
       "Description: The proposed solution focuses on implementing comprehensive career counselling and guidance programs in schools. This includes training career counsellors, developing resources and tools for career exploration, and integrating career guidance into the school curriculum. Programs should provide personalized counselling sessions, workshops, and access to information on various career paths and educational requirements. Additionally, leveraging technology to create interactive platforms for career exploration can enhance student engagement and awareness. These initiatives align with NEP 2020's vision of equipping students with the knowledge and skills to pursue their career aspirations.\n",
       "Innovative Solutions:\n",
       "a) AI-Powered Career Guidance Platforms: Develop AI-driven platforms that provide personalized career advice based on students' interests, strengths, and market trends.\n",

       "In today’s digital age, a wide variety of services and processes take place online. Users of these digital facilities are required to upload government-issued containing documents or provide data for successfully availing the services. However, the uploaded documents or data which are required to facilitate these digital services and processes contain personally identifiable information (PII), i.e. any data that can be used to identify an individual uniquely. These documents can be like Aadhaar card, PAN, Credit Card, Driving License etc and can include data like names, address, phone number, email address, and financial information, among others of the user. The handling of PII is crucial as its exposure can lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, and financial fraud among other cyber related issues.\n",
       "Detailed Description:\n",
       "The above problem statement envisages that an application be developed to identify whether PII, in the form of government-issued documents such as Aadhaar, Driving license, MHA-issued ID Cards, etc. is embedded in the uploaded document or provided data. Notable, the PII may be included inadvertently as well. PII, by its nature, is sensitive data, and its exposure must be protected against in order to safeguard users’ privacy. Entities and organizations handling documents or data containing users’ PII must be mindful of the complex challenges that arise with it – they have to balance data storage, encryption, access controls, data retention policies, data management processes with users’ knowledge and consent, notification of breaches by users, grievance redressal, etc. Such an application will aid in alerting individual users to verify whether it is necessary to upload or provide PII-containing document. Simultaneously, it will allow the personal data processing entity to check whether such PII document or data is required, and in case not necessary, help in removing, redacting or masking the PII\n",

       "Expected Solution:\n",
       "A software application or library package to detect and alert users when there is personally identifiable information (PII) related to identified government-issued identification documents (Aadhaar card, PAN, Driving License to start with) embedded in the uploaded documents or providing data, while uploading or reviewing. In addition, the software application may be placed in public domain and shall allow the receiver of the document in removing, redacting or masking the PII from the document and data, if required.</div>\n",

Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format.\n",
       "Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems.\n",
       "The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data.\n",
       "It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice.\n",
       "Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures.\n",

       "2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs.\n",
       "2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved.\n",
       "2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ‘price reasonability’ for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors.\n",
       "2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking.\n",
       "2.2 Detailed Description:\n",
       "2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows:\n",
       "i. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates.\n",
       "ii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price.\n",
       "iii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey.\n",
       "2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain.\n",
       "2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach).\n",
       "\n",
       "2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs.\n",
       "2.3 Expected Solution:\n",
       "2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness.\n",
       "2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services.\n",
       "2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user. The minimum input fields and the expected output fields are explained below, for various scenarios.\n",

Although these have caught imagination of computer and tech savvy generation, at the same time, these have created concerns because of their ability to disrupt nation’s politics, committing frauds, create dis-information and creating non-consensual contents. Use of Deep fake has also been seen recently to purposefully defame the character of a person in specific. Due to enhancements in AI/ML and Large Language Models for Generative AI, identification and detection of deep fakes have created a huge challenge for Security Agencies. Research on multiple aspects of deep fake identification has been started. As a use case for the problem statement, a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's may be developed.\n",
       "Detailed description: Addressing the deep fake problem requires a multi-pronged approach, combining technology, regulation, education, and collaboration to mitigate the risks and protect individuals and society. However, on the technological front Detecting deep fakes involves development and testing with numerous advanced algorithms and tools. Here are some of the prominent approaches and technologies that can be used in deep fake detection: \n",
       "i.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs can be trained to detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements. CNNs can also analyse video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and discrepancies. \n",
       "ii.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs and LSTMs can be used to analyse the sequence of frames in a video to detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes. \n",
       "iii.Capsule Networks: Capsule networks can identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture. \n",
       "iv.Adversarial Training: Adversarial training involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously training another model to detect them improving the robustness of detection algorithms. \n",
       "v.Audio-Visual Inconsistencies: Combining audio and visual analysis can also help detect deep fakes by identifying mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds. \n",
       "vi.Blockchain Technology: Using blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity. \n",
       "vii.Frequency Analysis: Analysing the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artefacts introduced during the deep fake creation process. \n",
       "viii.Biometric Verification: Analysing subtle behavioural traits such as micro-expressions, eye and head movement to detect anomalies. \n",
       "ix.Hybrid Models: Using a combination of spatial, temporal, audio and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection. \n",
       "Expected solution: A solution based on AI/ML technology may be developed to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. This technique may be based on any of the above-mentioned methods or it may combine multiple methods and demonstrate the final deliverable of detection of deep fakes with accuracy. The input of the system will be a video which is suspected of deep fake and the output should contain detailed report w.r.t various characteristics of deep fake e.g. whether confirmed fake (details of abnormalities observed), mathematical underlying techniques of its creation. \n",

In addition, one important requirement of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) is that solution should be “offline and on-premise” and should be “updated with latest definition on regular basis”. Therefore, the reliable and effective solution can be developed by creating a pipeline combining multiple AV engines working parallelly offline. \n",

       "Hydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. \n",
       "Description \n",
       "There is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively. \n",
       "Expected Solution \n",
       "There is need to develop a sophisticated model that can incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transient behavior of water within the water conductor system. This model should be able to handle complex scenarios such as sudden load changes, emergency shutdowns, start-up and other operational variations. Provide clear visual representations of pressure fluctuations, flow velocities and potential risk areas. This model should be adaptable to different hydropower and pumped storage systems with varying configurations and operational requirements.</div>\n",

NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies.\n",
       "As pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin.\n",
       "Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological &amp; hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River.\n",
       "Model source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling.\n",
       "The overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems.\n",
       "Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological &amp; hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network.\n",
       "a. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use.\n",
       "b. Dashboard may show the following options \n",
       "i. Ganga River set up a map with options for plotting flow, nitrate, ammonia, phosphorus, DO,BOD,Fecal Coliform and; etc.\n",
       "ii. It may show a time series plot of paramenters such as rainfall, flow, DO, BOD, Fecal Coliform and nitrate for the Ganga River over the past 10 days and a forecast ahead of 3 days.\n",
       "2. Alrets can be sent out to decision makers providing notice of an extreme event, e.g., pollution discharge, combined sewer pverflows discharges, high pathogen events, or a pulse of high nitrate water moving down the river system.\n",
       "3. DSS-based post-project monitoring to validate the benefit of government investments.</div>\n",

Long term groundwater level data acquired through regular monitoring of groundwater levels provide an opportunity to understand the behavior of the aquifers to changing stress regime. Central Ground Water Board periodically monitors ground water levels from nearly 26000 wells. CGWB is also in the process of installing Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLRs) across various parts of Indiaeach capturing and transmitting water level data four times per day. In addition to CGWB there are many other agencies measuring water levels. \n",
       "The software application is expected to analyse groundwater levels and factors impacting groundwater level like rainfall, hydrogeology, landuse, population, surface elevation, natural features, tidal cycles etc. Based on these factors and based on observed water level data, the software application should be able to predict and forecast groundwater levels both in space and time. The application will be accessible to all for predicting groundwater level at any place at any point on time. This will also help in filling data gaps in time-series data.</div>\n",

The game should take into account various interventions (artificial recharge, microirrigation, crop diversification) and possible scenarios (drought, surplus rain, contamination etc). The gamer can earn points or coins based on the choices that he (or she) makes. The scores of registered gamers will be stored online and water-smart youths can be identified and certified.

The scheme aims to demarcate inhabited (Abadi) land in rural areas through the latest surveying drone technology, Continuous Operating Reference System (CORS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization of properties and enabling bank loan; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning\n",

With the use latest drone technology and CORS technology for the Abadi land survey, the high resolution and accurate image base maps of 50 cm have facilitated creation of the most durable record of property holdings in these areas with no legacy revenue records.

       "In a SCADA system, for a pipeline network spanning thousands of kilometres, the network devices (both layer 2 and layer 3) are spread all along the geographical area. With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network.\n",
       "Problem Statement Details:\n",
       "“Develop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.”\n",

It encompasses a rich vocabulary of hand movements, facial expressions and body postures to convey messaging. ISL facilitates communication and fosters community among deaf individuals, enabling them to express emotions, share ideas and engage in every day interactions.\n",
       "Description: The need for audio to Indian Sign Language (ISL) conversion arrises from the communication barrier between the deaf community, which primarily uses ISL, and individuals who do not know sign language but communicate through spoken language. This barrier hinder effective communication in various settings, including education, healthcare and various interactions. Without a mean to convert audio into ISL, deaf individual faces challenging in accessing information and participating fully in society.\n",
       "Expected Solution: The expected solution entails developing technology-such as software or devices-capable of accurately converting spoken language to Indian Sign Language (ISL). This technology should use speech recognition, natural level processing, and computer vision to transcribe and interpret audio input, generating corresponding ISL gestures in real-time. It should prioritize accuracy, user-friendliness, and adaptibility to regional variation of ISL, thereby facilitating seamless communication between deaf individual and those who do not know sign language. \n",
       "For example: 1. Development of application by which announcement/ text display in railway platform Display Unit Converted to Indian Sign Language, so that deaf people can see it and understand the announcement.\n",

       "The Prime Minister's Special Scholarship Scheme (PMSSS) aims to support the education of students across India. Traditionally, the process of disbursing scholarships involves significant paperwork, including the submission and verification of documents, which can be time-consuming and prone to delays. The SAG Bureau seeks to streamline this process by developing an online mechanism that allows students to submit their documents digitally. This initiative will facilitate quicker verification and disbursement of scholarships without the need for hard copies, promoting efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of paper usage.\n",
       "Description:\n",
       "The proposed system will allow students to upload their required documents through a secure online portal. Upon submission, the documents will be automatically sent to the SAG Bureau for verification. Once verified, the SAG Bureau will forward the approved documents to the Finance Bureau for the release of payments. The system will ensure that the entire process, from document submission to scholarship disbursement, is conducted digitally, eliminating the need for any hard copy submissions.\n",
       "Key features of the system should include:\n",
       "• A user-friendly interface for students to upload and manage their documents.\n",
       "• Secure authentication and verification mechanisms to ensure the authenticity of the submitted documents.\n",
       "• An automated workflow to route the documents from the SAG Bureau to the Finance Bureau after verification.\n",
       "• Real-time tracking and notification system to keep students informed about the status of their submissions and payments.\n",
       "• Compliance with data privacy and security standards to protect the personal information of the students.\n",
       "Expected Solution:\n",
       "\n",
       "The expected solution is a comprehensive, fully digital system for the submission, verification, and disbursement of PMSSS scholarships. The solution should:\n",
       "• Enable students to upload their documents digitally and track their submission status.\n",
       "• Allow the SAG Bureau to verify the uploaded documents without the need for physical copies.\n",
       "• Facilitate the automatic forwarding of verified documents to the Finance Bureau for payment processing.\n",
       "• Ensure a seamless, paperless process that enhances efficiency, reduces processing time, and minimizes the risk of document loss or misplacement.\n",

Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun’s trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and Simulink®, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using Simulink® Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.\n",

SAR image colorization using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data. The project aims to develop an innovative solution to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced interpretation and analysis of feature targets. A novel DL model needs to be designed and trained using pairs of SAR and Optical images, minimizing a loss function that captures the difference between predicted and actual color images. The participants are challenged to create a DL system that can accurately predict and apply colors to SAR images, making surface features more distinguishable and interpretable.\n",

The satellite data from Indian Satellites such as Cartosat-2/3 and Cartosat-1 are capable of generating 3D city models up to LoD-1. These LoD1 models, which are derived by extruding a footprint to a uniform height, can be used for simulating building shadows. This project aims to develop an interactive application for assessing BIPV potential using LOD-1 3D city model.

       "\n",
       "However, 145,012 schools across the country fall into the \"\"odd\"\" school structure category\n",

The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases where a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial insight into the stability and security of the software. The process of fuzzing can be divided into following broad steps –\n",
       "1. Identification of Target Function(s) – Target function(s) are typically those functions that act as entry points for processing input data. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data.\n",
       "2. Developing harness – Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole purpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A harness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how the target application receives and processes the input.\n",
       "3. Fuzzing - In this step, a fuzzer is used to generate numerous data inputs which are then passed to the target function using the harness. The fuzzer checks whether the application crashes by processing a certain input. If a crash occurs, then it saves the input and the memory state of the crash to file for later analysis.\n",
       "Description:\n",
       "Fuzzing has proven its effectiveness in discovering thousands of vulnerabilities in file-processing and stateless applications. In fuzzing, and automated testing in general, designing test oracles is crucial.

In this challenge, teams are required to develop a working harness for fuzzing of the latest version (version 3.5.2 or later) of Windows Sumatra PDF Reader software solution, fuzzed on any fuzzer of their choice.\n",

The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery.\n",
       "Forensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence.\n",
       "Detailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data.\n",
       "Moreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms.\n",
       "Expected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to:\n",
       "1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data structures of XFS and Btrfs.\n",
       "2. Support a wide range of file types: Recover Text-Based Document Formats(doc,docx, rtf, pdf, txt, odt, html, xml, ppt, odp, xls, ods, log, csv, tsv, txt, conf, ini, cfg etc), archives file(zip, tar, rar, iso, rpm, deb etc), Image-Based Document Formats(jpg, jpeg, png, gif, tif etc), executables binaries(.elf, .so, .a, exe, dll, bat, cmd) scripts files(ps, ps1, sh, bash, zsh, py etc), database file(.db etc) and other relevant data formats.\n",
       "3. Extract complete metadata: Recover accurate creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, file names, and other essential metadata associated with deleted files.\n",
       "4. Provide user-friendly interface: Offer an intuitive interface (GUI/CLI) for easily navigate recovered data and generate reports.\n",
       "5. Ensure data integrity: Implement robust data validation and verification mechanisms to maintain the integrity of recovered data.</div>\n",

       " Two aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine – The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important.\n",
       " TKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour\n",
       " It is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation.\n",
       " TKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour)\n",
       " Where, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift.\n",
       " Assessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory.\n",
       " More is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must.\n",
       " Actions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL’s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle’s Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition.\n",
       " Tyre Pressure\n",
       " Proper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources.\n",
       " Expected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime.\n",
       " Tyre Performance Analysis\n",
       " Apart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres.\n",
       " Such analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.</div>\n",

       " ln Science Museums/ Centres exhibits are mostly interactive in nature. Interactive exhibits are the lifeblood of science centers, but keeping them functioning smoothly can be a challenge. It poses the problem of regular maintenance. It has also been observed that defects remain unattended for long due to not being identified. It creates a genuine problem for the visitors' experience and sometimes they are not aware of the optimum result. Here lines the requirement for an automated defective exhibit identification system.\n",
       " Description:\n",
       " It is a real-life problem in big Museum/ Science Museum/Centres, where there is inadequacy of manpower. Following are the problems in a nutshell that arose due to unnoticed and undiagnosed defects of the exhibits.\n",
       " High Maintenance Needs: Unlike static displays, interactive elements have more moving parts, software, and technology that require regular upkeep to function properly these are considered as \"\"golden parameters of any particular Exhibits\"\". Theses parameters are to be kept functional to keep the exhibits in a running condition.\n",
       " Frustration for Visitors: Encountering a non-functional exhibit can be frustrating for visitors, especially children, who may not understand why it's not working.\n",
       " Missed Learning Opportunities: Broken/ non-functional exhibits prevent visitors from fully engaging with the science concepts they're designed to teach.\n",
       " Because of their complexity, malfunctions might not be immediately obvious to visitors or staff, leading to a broken experience. Also creates a bad impression for that particular gallery and ultimately to the science center or to Science Museums.\n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " Now, with the emergence of artificial intelligence, it transpires that amalgamation of Al with automation may give efficient result to detect defective exhibits placed in the galleries and give the feedback to the concerned section for immediate repairing initiative and rectify the exhibits. Thus, aiming a flawless learning experience or edutainment in Science Museum or in Science Center.\n",

       " Milk is perishable product, it requires immediate processing after few hours (2-4Hrs) of production, otherwise, bacterial load increases and milk gets deteriorate. At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is\n",

This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons.\n",
       " Description: The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions. Take 10 ml milk sample in sterile MBRT test tube. Add 1 ml MBRT dye solution (dye concentration 0.005%). Stopper the tubes with sterilized rubber stopper and carefully place them in a test tube stand dipped in a serological water bath maintained at 37t1oC. Record this time as the beginning of the incubation period. Decolourization is considered complete when only a faint blue ring (about 5mm) persists at the top. However, for processed dairy products, the enumeration of bacterial load is time-consuming and requires different methods.\n",
       " Expected solution: The above mentioned MBRT takes 4 to 6 Hours for completion of the test. Therefore, it is proposed to develop cost effective, rapid and portable method/Machine to deduct microbial load in Raw and Pasteurized Milk as compared to present Methylene blue reduction test (MBRT).Meanwhile, smart packaging tools such as freshness indicators could be a solution for processed dairy products.ln this context, artificial intelligence, machine vision, systems, etc. could be explored.</div>\n",

For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985.\n",
       " Description: It is observed that some of the firms with valid URN to be handling any of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemical, divert the same from licit channel and traffic it for manufacturing of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Further, the investigations conducted also reveal that the firms usually create documentation of the movement of precursor to a licit firm for a licit activity and divert the same for illicit activities. Therefore, there is a need for end-to-end tracking of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemicals (controlled substances)\n",
       " Expected Solution: A hardware/software/chemical solution for end-to-end tracking of dual use chemicals used in both legitimate industries and illicit drug production from point of manufacture to point of end use/export\n",

Due to low levels of water metering in irrigation, it is challenging to control theft from canals and unauthorized ground water extractions. Therefore, ET based technologies can enforce water accounting / auditing and thus enhance Water Use Efficiency (WUE). \n",
       " However, the EOS based ET technology has certain limitations i.e. low accuracy under cloudy conditions and low resolutions. Therefore, the drone-based ET systems can be used to bridge this data gap. \n",
       " Description: The idea is to estimate the actual water consumption by the crops (i.e. AET) in a targeted irrigated command area (ranging from 50 Ha to 5000 Ha) with the help of a drone based system. This system should have a portable drone control module along with an in-built Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&amp;ML) mechanism to work out AET and calibrate against the satellite-based ET inputs. Once integrated with cadastral maps, it should be tailored for individual farm level water control. \n",
       " Expected Solution: A drone fitted with suitable ET sensing system to bridge the data gaps/limitations from Satellite based ET system for calculation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of different crops under survey. The AI&amp;ML algorithm using historical data and satellite based inputs should be able to give various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at farm level like (i) Type of Crop; (ii) Crop monitoring (seeding/sowing/harvest/ disease etc); (iii) Water Auditing/Water Accounting: (iv) Over irrigated vs under irrigated/Ground water use; etc. \n",
       " These KPI's can provide an insight of farmer irrigation decision-making; estimation of irrigation water use; farmer irrigation behavior heuristics and management practices, including the scheduling and efficiency of irrigation decisions. The software model can be polished over time in different irrigation commands to improve the accuracy and reliability of irrigation water use estimation. This will give a complete control of water use and agriculture productivity at field through remote sensing and help in increasing the Groundwater Level in critical unsafe areas.</div>\n",

       " The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind presents significant challenges due to their intermittent nature. This variability can strain the power grid, leading to inefficiencies and reliability issues. Traditional grid infrastructure is not designed to handle these fluctuations effectively, resulting in energy wastage and a reliance on fossil fuel-based backup power. Energy storage systems (ESS) offer a potential solution by storing excess energy generated during peak production periods and releasing it during times of high demand or low generation, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply.\n",

       " Description:\n",
       " The task is to design an innovative and efficient energy storage system to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources and stabilize the grid. This requires addressing several key challenges: high costs, technological limitations, and regulatory barriers. Current ESS technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, pumped hydro storage, and flow batteries, each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Innovative ideas need to be explored to reduce costs, enhance storage capacities, and improve the efficiency and lifespan of these technologies. Additionally, how to navigate and potentially reform regulatory frameworks to support the widespread adoption of ESS may also be explored.\n",

       " Develop approaches to lower the initial and operational costs of ESS, potentially through new materials, manufacturing processes, or economies of scale. Identify or create advanced ESS technologies that offer higher efficiency, greater storage capacity, and longer operational lifespans. Suggest changes to policies and regulations that facilitate ESS integration, including safety standards, performance metrics, and grid interconnection protocols. Formulate strategies to engage key stakeholders, including policymakers, utility companies, and consumers, to build support for ESS deployment.

       " Coal is the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India. It accounts for 55% of the country's energy need. The country's industrial heritage was built upon indigenous coal. Our countries major production of Electricity is achieved through coal fired thermal power plant which is around 3/4th of the total power generation and also the biggest source of Carbon emission. India updated its NDC according to which the target: To reduce emissions intensity of its GDP has been enhanced to 45% by 2030 from 2005 level. India's also creating energy transition pathway to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to reduce the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. However, owning to energy security issue the role of coal cannot be ruled out in immediate future till various storage solution gets mature and become available at affordable cost.\n",

       " Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is a promising technology that can help India meet its energy security and emission reduction goals. CCUS can be retrofitted to existing power and industrial plants, allowing for their continued operation. CCS was acknowledged as a solution for climate mitigation by IPCC. However, IPCC also noted that CCS has the highest cost and lowest possible contribution to net emission reduction in both energy and industry sectors. This problem is having potential opportunity for innovators, researchers and start-ups. In order to meet the 1.5°C goal, IPCC projects the need to have technical geological storage of about 1,000 GtCO2. However, the availability of geological storage is highly location dependent and there are several technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-cultural barriers to implementing CCS, according to IPCC.\n",

The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.\n",
       " Detailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example:\n",
       " 60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam\n",
       " 40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam\n",
       " 30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam.\n",
       " Since January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student’s responses. Also some of the people are misusing the benefits by training or teaching the scribe rather than the child with SLD to write the exam and score good marks.\n",

One of the major reasons for disability among the elderly people is falls. Every year, one-third of community-dwelling older adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall. Falls, defined as “unexpected event[s] in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level,” are responsible for a wide range of negative health outcomes. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults, and the age-adjusted fall death rate (64 deaths per 100,000 older adults) increased by 30%. Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause older adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of falling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect whereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their everyday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and more susceptible to future falls. In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual’s strength, balance, and mobility\n",
       " Description: Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants’ presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more\n",
       " The recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people.\n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " These technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers</div>\n",

Functional body powered upper limb prosthesis can replace the functions of upper limb for ADL activities up to some extent. But in higher level of upper limb amputation, it becomes difficult for the patient to manage ADL activities. The requirement of externally powered prosthesis such as myoelectric prosthesis plays a vital role in this aspect.\n",
       " Description of Problem statement: \n",
       " A myoelectric prosthesis is an externally powered prosthesis which is controlled by muscle contraction (muscle action potential). In market, many variants of myoelectric prostheses are available with various features. The most important feature of these prostheses is the grasping pattern types and also it indicates about movement of different fingers in prosthesis. Because it is expensive, access to these high-end prosthesesbecomes challenging for patients with upper limb amputation living in developing nations like India. Even though few myoelectric prostheses are available in market with less cost, but the features are limited and are not working precisely. \n",
       " Expected Solutions: \n",
       " Experts from different disciplines, such as engineers for creating programs and fabrication of controlling circuits and Prosthetist for fabrication of sockets and fitment of the prostheses are required to design and develop a cost-effective myoelectric prosthesis. Most important feature of the prosthesis is the grasping pattern which is completely dependent on the prosthetic hand. Thus, design and fabrication of prosthetic hand also plays a vital role in the complete working mechanism of the prosthesis. Thus, to get a successful result, it is possible to work collaboratively with experts from different discipline.\n",

These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class.\n",
       " Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately.\n",
       " Detailed Description:\n",
       " Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler’s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis.\n",
       " A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification.\n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird\n",
       " Output: Class of the object(Drone or Bird)</div>\n",

       " The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand.\n",
       " Description:\n",
       " The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs.\n",
       " Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive.\n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.</div>\n",

       " 4. Real-Time Job Market Insights based on candidate’s skills and competencies:\n",
       " • Dashboard: Create a dashboard displaying real-time data on trending jobs, skills in demand, and salary benchmarks.\n",
       " • Data Analytics: Use data analytics to provide insights into job market trends and forecast future skill requirements.\n",
       " 5. Skills Verification and Certification:\n",

       " There are numerous engineering and polytechnic institutes in Rajasthan running under the Department of Technical Education, Government of Rajasthan. Notably, during the admission process, there is a significant increase in enquiries from various groups, including students, their parents, and other stakeholders. These enquiries cover a wide range of queries related to admission process, eligibility criteria, information about different colleges, fee structure, curriculum , scholarship , hostel facilities, previous year's college and branch-specific allotments placement opportunities and many more. \n",
       " Currently, stakeholders have tocontact colleges individually through phone or email, and sometimes even visit the colleges personally. This process is not only cumbersome for the stakeholders but also demanding to pool manpower for the colleges to manage these inquiries. \n",
       " Detailed Description: \n",
       " With the continuous rise in enquiries, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the colleges to respond promptly and effectively using traditional communication methods. To address this issue more efficiently and ensure timely assistance for everyone, there is a \n",
       " pressing need to adopt new technological solutions. One effective approach is to develop an \n",
       " AI-powered chatbot at centralized level that would serve as a virtual assistant, available 24/7 to answer a wide range of questions. By automating responses to common enquiries, the chatbot would significantly enhance the accessibility to important information and allow staff to focus on handling more complex queries and other critical tasks. For example, the chatbot would provide insights into information about various engineering and polytechnic colleges that falls under the jurisdiction of Department of Technical Education, and guide users through the admission processes, explain fee structures, share curriculum updates, provide details about available scholarships, share alumni information, and share information on job placement opportunities etc \n",
       " This will empower the technical education department because of the ease of providing information, help and advice instantly to prospective students, their parents, and all interested parties. The required information provided by all colleges can be integrated with ease in software. \n",
       " Expected Solutions: \n",
       " 1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot should rapidly access and provide accurate information from a comprehensive database on topics such as admissions, fees, scholarships, recommendations based on previous years cutoff, minimizing the need for human assistance. Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to support voice based assistance in English languages and can be extended in Hindi and other regional languages ensuring wide accessibility and understanding. \n",
       " 2. Enhanced User Experience: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate easily and find information quickly. The interface should be straightforward, accessible on common platform, and capable of understanding natural language, ensuring user-friendliness. \n",
       " 3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), the chatbot will reduce the workload on department staff, allowing them to concentrate on more complex and urgent tasks. \n",
       " 4. Data Insights: The chatbot will gather valuable data from user interactions, helping the department to identify common concerns and optimize it’s services based on these insights. \n",

       " Gap analysis between C emission and sinks and suggesting pathways to carbon neutrality\n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " A comprehensive software solution that includes:\n",
       " Emission estimation: The app would allow users to input data on various mining activities (e.g., excavation, transportation, equipment usage) and estimate the associated carbon emissions based on establishd emission factors. Estimation of Per Capita emissions of a Mine.\n",
       " Carbon Neutrality Pathways: The app could offer features for simulating different emission reduction strategies like:\n",
       " Clean technologies: Assessing the impact of adopting electric vehicles, methane capture systems, and renewable energy sources for mine operations.\n",
       " Afforestation offsets: Calculating the amount of land required for tree plantation to offset remaining emissions based on state specific afforestation plan and Carbon emission reduction.\n",
       " Other Renewables: explore alternative use of energy to reduce direct electricity consumption.\n",
       " Any other pathways:\n",
       " Carbon Credits: Estimation of potential Carbon credit earned as per present market rates.\n",

       " Despite the thrust on energy transition from fossil fuel sector to a cost-competitive renewable energy sector, Coal will remain pivotal to energy security of the nation in near future. India is targeting for 1.5 Bt coal production by 2030 to cater to the burgeoning energy needs of the country. To achieve the target, improved productivity and safety in coal mining is pivotal.\n",
       " Description:\n",
       " The problem statement is divided into two parts: one is Digital shift handover log system and other is safety management plan as per DGMS guidelines.\n",
       " A digital shift handover log system is a valuable tool for streamlining and improving the transition of responsibilities and information from one shift to the next within an organization.\n",
       " The problem statement envisages that an app based and web based Shift handover log system be developed as per the Statutory and non-statutory log format currently in practice, which is presently being done manually through paper logs. This will ensure sharing of critical information and briefing of the next shift digitally. It will provide supervisors and operators with an immediate, comprehensive overview of the outgoing shift’s activities.\n",
       " Manual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life.\n",
       " Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same.\n",
       " This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine.\n",
       " Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. \n",
       " Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. \n",
       " Possible Solution:\n",
       " An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines.\n",
       " Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.</div>\n",

Long queues are common, especially during peak hours, weekends, or special exhibitions, leading to frustration and impatience among visitors. Besides the wait times, the manual system is prone to errors, such as incorrect ticket issuance, double bookings, or lost records, which can cause further delays and inconvenience. Overall, these challenges associated with manual ticket booking systems significantly detract from the visitor experience, reducing satisfaction and potentially impacting the museum's reputation and visitor numbers.\n",

       " Many organization are using Cloud for hosting their web applications. The attackers can try to attack these webservers for achieving Denial of Service attack. Specifically, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network of Cloud infrastructure by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems assources of attack traffic.\n",
       " Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate security tools to counter and protect against these attacks.\n",
       " \n",
       " • Description:\n",
       " The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further\n",
       " investigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS.\n",
       " Following are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack:\n",
       " 1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range\n",
       " 2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version\n",
       " 3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint\n",
       " 4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)\n",
       " There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also.\n",
       " For the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made:\n",
       " 1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users.\n",
       " 2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability).\n",
       " 3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS).\n",
       " 4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver.\n",
       " 5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure.\n",
       " A solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack.\n",
       " \n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " A set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools\n",
       " should be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack.

Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. \n",
       " Detailed description: \n",
       " The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. \n",
       " To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.\n",
       " Option 1 : off Mumbai: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HUisEfMA20ilODdeoRYVneG2i1ZbRBNB/view?usp=drive_link\n",

       " https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_iEcojaZNaezOqKwxHtCenjgOW58lPgA/view?usp=drive_link\n",
       " Expected solution: Automated oil spill detection system for early detection of oil spills\n",
       " A software/tool/system to be developed for detecting oil spills/vessel in distress with suitable methodology that involves programming in python. The tool/system should detect the anomalies in AIS around the vessel. The distress/anomaly zone has to be monitored for oil spills using Satellite datasets. This can help in early detection of oil leak from a ship or vessel. The information can be passed on to the regulatory authorities for quicker and efficient response.</div>\n",

       " INCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis.\n",
       " Detailed Description:\n",
       " Considering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. \n",
       " Data input, classification and arrangement \n",
       " The software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight.\n",
       " Users, Data output and visualization\n",
       " The users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth.\n",
       " -In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence.\n",
       " Data Accessibility\n",
       " The Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data.\n",
       " Expected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.</div>\n",

Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry.\n",
       " Description: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship’s motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters.

However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes.\n",
       " Description: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields.\n",
       " The DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ.\n",
       " If a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes.\n",
       " This system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency.\n",
       " Expected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy. This system has to be applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, government agencies, and more.</div>\n",

It was also accepted that these SDGs are not possible to achieve without changing humanity’s relationship with the oceans. To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/).\n",

       " Description: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html.\n",
       " \n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " The user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly.\n",

Users of these digital facilities are required to upload government-issued containing documents or provide data for successfully availing the services. However, the uploaded documents or data which are required to facilitate these digital services and processes contain personally identifiable information (PII), i.e. any data that can be used to identify an individual uniquely. These documents can be like Aadhaar card, PAN, Credit Card, Driving License etc and can include data like names, address, phone number, email address, and financial information, among others of the user. The handling of PII is crucial as its exposure can lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, and financial fraud among other cyber related issues.\n",

       " The above problem statement envisages that an application be developed to identify whether PII, in the form of government-issued documents such as Aadhaar, Driving license, MHA-issued ID Cards, etc. is embedded in the uploaded document or provided data. Notable, the PII may be included inadvertently as well. PII, by its nature, is sensitive data, and its exposure must be protected against in order to safeguard users’ privacy. Entities and organizations handling documents or data containing users’ PII must be mindful of the complex challenges that arise with it – they have to balance data storage, encryption, access controls, data retention policies, data management processes with users’ knowledge and consent, notification of breaches by users, grievance redressal, etc. Such an application will aid in alerting individual users to verify whether it is necessary to upload or provide PII-containing document. Simultaneously, it will allow the personal data processing entity to check whether such PII document or data is required, and in case not necessary, help in removing, redacting or masking the PII\n",

Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format.\n",
       " Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems.\n",
       " The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data.\n",
       " It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice.\n",
       " Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures.\n",

       " 2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs.\n",
       " 2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved.\n",
       " 2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ‘price reasonability’ for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors.\n",
       " 2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking.\n",
       " 2.2 Detailed Description:\n",
       " 2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows:\n",
       " i. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates.\n",
       " ii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price.\n",
       " iii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey.\n",
       " 2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain.\n",
       " 2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach).\n",
       " \n",
       " 2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs.\n",
       " 2.3 Expected Solution:\n",
       " 2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness.\n",
       " 2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services.\n",
       " 2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user. The minimum input fields and the expected output fields are explained below, for various scenarios.\n",

Although these have caught imagination of computer and tech savvy generation, at the same time, these have created concerns because of their ability to disrupt nation’s politics, committing frauds, create dis-information and creating non-consensual contents. Use of Deep fake has also been seen recently to purposefully defame the character of a person in specific. Due to enhancements in AI/ML and Large Language Models for Generative AI, identification and detection of deep fakes have created a huge challenge for Security Agencies. Research on multiple aspects of deep fake identification has been started. As a use case for the problem statement, a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's may be developed.\n",
       " Detailed description: Addressing the deep fake problem requires a multi-pronged approach, combining technology, regulation, education, and collaboration to mitigate the risks and protect individuals and society. However, on the technological front Detecting deep fakes involves development and testing with numerous advanced algorithms and tools. Here are some of the prominent approaches and technologies that can be used in deep fake detection: \n",
       " i.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs can be trained to detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements. CNNs can also analyse video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and discrepancies. \n",
       " ii.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs and LSTMs can be used to analyse the sequence of frames in a video to detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes. \n",
       " iii.Capsule Networks: Capsule networks can identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture. \n",
       " iv.Adversarial Training: Adversarial training involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously training another model to detect them improving the robustness of detection algorithms. \n",
       " v.Audio-Visual Inconsistencies: Combining audio and visual analysis can also help detect deep fakes by identifying mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds. \n",
       " vi.Blockchain Technology: Using blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity. \n",
       " vii.Frequency Analysis: Analysing the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artefacts introduced during the deep fake creation process. \n",
       " viii.Biometric Verification: Analysing subtle behavioural traits such as micro-expressions, eye and head movement to detect anomalies. \n",
       " ix.Hybrid Models: Using a combination of spatial, temporal, audio and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection. \n",
       " Expected solution: A solution based on AI/ML technology may be developed to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. This technique may be based on any of the above-mentioned methods or it may combine multiple methods and demonstrate the final deliverable of detection of deep fakes with accuracy. The input of the system will be a video which is suspected of deep fake and the output should contain detailed report w.r.t various characteristics of deep fake e.g. whether confirmed fake (details of abnormalities observed), mathematical underlying techniques of its creation. \n",

In addition, one important requirement of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) is that solution should be “offline and on-premise” and should be “updated with latest definition on regular basis”. Therefore, the reliable and effective solution can be developed by creating a pipeline combining multiple AV engines working parallelly offline. \n",

       " Hydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. \n",
       " Description \n",
       " There is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively. \n",
       " Expected Solution \n",
       " There is need to develop a sophisticated model that can incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transient behavior of water within the water conductor system. This model should be able to handle complex scenarios such as sudden load changes, emergency shutdowns, start-up and other operational variations.

NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies.\n",
       " As pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin.\n",
       " Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological &amp; hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River.\n",
       " Model source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling.\n",
       " The overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems.\n",
       " Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological &amp; hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network.\n",
       " a. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use.\n",
       " b. Dashboard may show the following options \n",
       " i. Ganga River set up a map with options for plotting flow, nitrate, ammonia, phosphorus, DO,BOD,Fecal Coliform and; etc.\n",
       " ii. It may show a time series plot of paramenters such as rainfall, flow, DO, BOD, Fecal Coliform and nitrate for the Ganga River over the past 10 days and a forecast ahead of 3 days.\n",
       " 2. Alrets can be sent out to decision makers providing notice of an extreme event, e.g., pollution discharge, combined sewer pverflows discharges, high pathogen events, or a pulse of high nitrate water moving down the river system.\n",
       " 3. DSS-based post-project monitoring to validate the benefit of government investments.</div>\n",

Long term groundwater level data acquired through regular monitoring of groundwater levels provide an opportunity to understand the behavior of the aquifers to changing stress regime. Central Ground Water Board periodically monitors ground water levels from nearly 26000 wells. CGWB is also in the process of installing Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLRs) across various parts of Indiaeach capturing and transmitting water level data four times per day. In addition to CGWB there are many other agencies measuring water levels. \n",
       " The software application is expected to analyse groundwater levels and factors impacting groundwater level like rainfall, hydrogeology, landuse, population, surface elevation, natural features, tidal cycles etc. Based on these factors and based on observed water level data, the software application should be able to predict and forecast groundwater levels both in space and time. The application will be accessible to all for predicting groundwater level at any place at any point on time. This will also help in filling data gaps in time-series data.</div>\n",

The game should take into account various interventions (artificial recharge, microirrigation, crop diversification) and possible scenarios (drought, surplus rain, contamination etc). The gamer can earn points or coins based on the choices that he (or she) makes. The scores of registered gamers will be stored online and water-smart youths can be identified and certified.

The Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the SVAMITVA Scheme on the National Panchayati Raj Day, 24th April 2020 with a resolve to enable the economic progress of Rural India by providing “Record of Rights” to every rural household owner. The scheme aims to demarcate inhabited (Abadi) land in rural areas through the latest surveying drone technology, Continuous Operating Reference System (CORS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization of properties and enabling bank loan; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning\n",
       " 2. With the use latest drone technology and CORS technology for the Abadi land survey, the high resolution and accurate image base maps of 50 cm have facilitated creation of the most durable record of property holdings in these areas with no legacy revenue records.

       " In a SCADA system, for a pipeline network spanning thousands of kilometres, the network devices (both layer 2 and layer 3) are spread all along the geographical area. With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network.\n",
       " Problem Statement Details:\n",
       " “Develop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.”\n",

ISL facilitates communication and fosters community among deaf individuals, enabling them to express emotions, share ideas and engage in every day interactions.\n",

This barrier hinder effective communication in various settings, including education, healthcare and various interactions. Without a mean to convert audio into ISL, deaf individual faces challenging in accessing information and participating fully in society.\n",
       " Expected Solution: The expected solution entails developing technology-such as software or devices-capable of accurately converting spoken language to Indian Sign Language (ISL). This technology should use speech recognition, natural level processing, and computer vision to transcribe and interpret audio input, generating corresponding ISL gestures in real-time. It should prioritize accuracy, user-friendliness, and adaptibility to regional variation of ISL, thereby facilitating seamless communication between deaf individual and those who do not know sign language. \n",

       " The Prime Minister's Special Scholarship Scheme (PMSSS) aims to support the education of students across India. Traditionally, the process of disbursing scholarships involves significant paperwork, including the submission and verification of documents, which can be time-consuming and prone to delays. The SAG Bureau seeks to streamline this process by developing an online mechanism that allows students to submit their documents digitally. This initiative will facilitate quicker verification and disbursement of scholarships without the need for hard copies, promoting efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of paper usage.\n",
       " Description:\n",
       " The proposed system will allow students to upload their required documents through a secure online portal. Upon submission, the documents will be automatically sent to the SAG Bureau for verification. Once verified, the SAG Bureau will forward the approved documents to the Finance Bureau for the release of payments. The system will ensure that the entire process, from document submission to scholarship disbursement, is conducted digitally, eliminating the need for any hard copy submissions.\n",
       " Key features of the system should include:\n",
       " • A user-friendly interface for students to upload and manage their documents.\n",
       " • Secure authentication and verification mechanisms to ensure the authenticity of the submitted documents.\n",
       " • An automated workflow to route the documents from the SAG Bureau to the Finance Bureau after verification.\n",
       " • Real-time tracking and notification system to keep students informed about the status of their submissions and payments.\n",
       " • Compliance with data privacy and security standards to protect the personal information of the students.\n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " \n",
       " The expected solution is a comprehensive, fully digital system for the submission, verification, and disbursement of PMSSS scholarships. The solution should:\n",
       " • Enable students to upload their documents digitally and track their submission status.\n",
       " • Allow the SAG Bureau to verify the uploaded documents without the need for physical copies.\n",
       " • Facilitate the automatic forwarding of verified documents to the Finance Bureau for payment processing.\n",
       " • Ensure a seamless, paperless process that enhances efficiency, reduces processing time, and minimizes the risk of document loss or misplacement.\n",

Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun’s trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and Simulink®, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using Simulink® Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.\n",

SAR image colorization using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data. The project aims to develop an innovative solution to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced interpretation and analysis of feature targets. A novel DL model needs to be designed and trained using pairs of SAR and Optical images, minimizing a loss function that captures the difference between predicted and actual color images. The participants are challenged to create a DL system that can accurately predict and apply colors to SAR images, making surface features more distinguishable and interpretable.\n",
       " Challenge: The challenges require innovative approaches in data pre-processing, DL model design, and evaluation methodologies to develop effective and reliable SAR image colorization solutions.\n",
       " Usage: The goal is to improve the usability of SAR data in applications like geological studies and environmental monitoring by providing more intuitive and informative visual representations.\n",

       " ODD School Structure refers to schools that do not conform to the standard categories\n",
       " defined by the Ministry of Education under the UDISE+ portal. These standard categories are\n",
       " designed to align with the Samagra Shiksha framework, which aims to ensure uniformity\n",
       " and consistency in the educational structures across the country. Schools falling outside\n",
       " these categories, due to variations in grade configurations, are classified as having \"\"odd\n",
       " structures.\"\"\n",
       " \n",
       " However, 145,012 schools across the country fall into the \"\"odd\"\" school structure category\n",
       " due to variations in grade configurations. These odd structures pose challenges for the\n",
       " uniform implementation of educational policies and schemes, such as Samagra Shiksha. This\n",
       " misalignment is particularly significant in states like Goa, Mizoram, West Bengal, and Kerala,\n",
       " where the majority of schools do not conform to the standard categories.\n",
       " \n",
       " Description:\n",
       " The problem of odd school structures affects the equitable distribution of resources,\n",
       " effective policy implementation, and the overall quality of education. Schools with odd\n",
       " structures are often excluded from the streamlined processes and benefits that come with\n",
       " standardization. The national average of schools with odd structures is 14.28%, but in some\n",
       " states, the percentage is much higher, complicating the delivery of educational initiatives.\n",
       " The objective is to standardize these odd school structures by aligning them with the\n",
       " defined categories under Samagra Shiksha, thereby improving the uniformity and\n",
       " effectiveness of educational policies across the country.\n",
       " \n",
       " Innovative Solutions:\n",

       " A. AI-Driven School Structure Analysis Tool: Develop software that uses AI to analyze\n",

       " them as odd structures. This tool can also suggest optimal restructuring options to\n",
       " align schools with the standard categories.\n",
       " B. Standardization Support Platform: Create a platform that provides guidelines, best\n",
       " practices, and resources for schools to transition from odd to standard structures.\n",
       " The platform could include modules on infrastructure planning, grade\n",
       " reconfiguration, and community engagement strategies.\n",
       " C. Dynamic Resource Allocation System: Develop a system that allows for flexible\n",
       " resource allocation based on school structures. This system would help in\n",
       " distributing resources more equitably by taking into account the specific needs of\n",
       " schools with odd structures during the transition period.\n",
       " D. Progress Monitoring Dashboard: Implement a real-time dashboard for monitoring\n",
       " the progress of schools as they transition from odd to standard structures. This\n",
       " dashboard would provide insights to policymakers and administrators, allowing them\n",

       " E. Interactive Stakeholder Engagement Portal: Develop an online portal to engage with\n",
       " school administrators, teachers, and the community. This portal could include\n",

The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases where a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial insight into the stability and security of the software. The process of fuzzing can be divided into following broad steps –\n",
       " 1. Identification of Target Function(s) – Target function(s) are typically those functions that act as entry points for processing input data. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data.\n",
       " 2. Developing harness – Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole purpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A harness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how the target application receives and processes the input.\n",
       " 3. Fuzzing - In this step, a fuzzer is used to generate numerous data inputs which are then passed to the target function using the harness. The fuzzer checks whether the application crashes by processing a certain input. If a crash occurs, then it saves the input and the memory state of the crash to file for later analysis.\n",

However, their widespread use also makes them prime targets for security vulnerabilities. Identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities during the development phase is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of these applications. Static analysis provides a method to examine code for vulnerabilities without executing it, allowing developers to catch and fix security issues early.\n",
       " Detailed Description: This report outlines a comprehensive framework for conducting static analysis to detect vulnerabilities in Android applications. The framework covers the following key aspects:\n",
       " 1.Preparation\n",
       " â€¢ Gather Requirements: Define the scope and objectives of the static analysis process. Determine which parts of the application will be analyzed and the specific types of vulnerabilities to look for.\n",
       " â€¢ Select Tools: Choose appropriate static analysis tools tailored for Android development such as MobSF, SonarQube, Android Lint, FindBugs, and PMD.\n",
       " 2. Code Review\n",
       " â€¢ Manual Code Review: Perform a thorough review of the source code to identify obvious security flaws. This step involves examining the code for insecure coding practices, such as hardcoded credentials, improper exception handling, and insecure data storage.\n",
       " â€¢ Automated Static Analysis: Use automated tools to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities. These tools can quickly identify issues such as insecure API usage, improper permissions, and potential injection points.\n",
       " 3. Configuration Analysis\n",
       " â€¢ Manifest File Review: Analyze the AndroidManifest.xml file for insecure configurations, such as exported components that should be private, overly broad permissions, and improper use of intents.\n",
       " â€¢ Build Configuration Review: Examine build.gradle files to ensure secure configurations and identify potential issues related to dependency management and build settings.\n",
       " 4. Dependency Analysis\n",
       " â€¢ Third-Party Libraries: Identify and evaluate third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities. Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and do not introduce security risks into the application.\n",
       " 5. Reporting\n",
       " â€¢ Document Findings: Prepare a detailed report outlining the identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and potential impact. The report should include specific examples of the code where vulnerabilities were found and explanations of why they pose a risk.\n",
       " â€¢ Prioritize Issues: Rank vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact on the application. This helps in focusing remediation efforts on the most critical issues first.\n",
       " 6. Mitigation and Remediation\n",
       " â€¢ Propose Fixes: Provide specific recommendations for addressing the identified vulnerabilities. This includes suggesting secure coding practices, configuration changes, and updates to third-party libraries.\n",
       " â€¢ Integrate Fixes: Work with the development team to integrate the recommended fixes into the codebase. This step may involve revising the application architecture, modifying code, and updating dependencies.\n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " 1.Early Detection of Vulnerabilities: Identifying security issues early in the development process, allowing for timely remediation.\n",
       " 2. Improved Code Quality: Encouraging secure coding practices and reducing the likelihood of introducing security flaws.\n",
       " 3. Increased Security Awareness: Raising awareness among developers about common security issues and how to avoid them.\n",
       " 4.Enhanced Application Security: Reducing the risk of exploitation by addressing vulnerabilities before the application is deployed to production.\n",

The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery.\n",
       " Forensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence.\n",
       " Detailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data.\n",
       " Moreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms.\n",
       " Expected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to:\n",
       " 1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data structures of XFS and Btrfs.\n",
       " 2. Support a wide range of file types: Recover Text-Based Document Formats(doc,docx, rtf, pdf, txt, odt, html, xml, ppt, odp, xls, ods, log, csv, tsv, txt, conf, ini, cfg etc), archives file(zip, tar, rar, iso, rpm, deb etc), Image-Based Document Formats(jpg, jpeg, png, gif, tif etc), executables binaries(.elf, .so, .a, exe, dll, bat, cmd) scripts files(ps, ps1, sh, bash, zsh, py etc), database file(.db etc) and other relevant data formats.\n",
       " 3. Extract complete metadata: Recover accurate creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, file names, and other essential metadata associated with deleted files.\n",
       " 4. Provide user-friendly interface: Offer an intuitive interface (GUI/CLI) for easily navigate recovered data and generate reports.\n",
       " 5. Ensure data integrity: Implement robust data validation and verification mechanisms to maintain the integrity of recovered data.</div>\n",

       " Two aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine – The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important.\n",
       " TKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour\n",
       " It is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation.\n",
       " TKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour)\n",
       " Where, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift.\n",
       " Assessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory.\n",
       " More is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must.\n",
       " Actions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL’s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle’s Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition.\n",
       " Tyre Pressure\n",
       " Proper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources.\n",
       " Expected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime.\n",
       " Tyre Performance Analysis\n",
       " Apart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres.\n",
       " Such analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.</div>\n",

       " Milk is perishable product, it requires immediate processing after few hours (2-4Hrs) of production, otherwise, bacterial load increases and milk gets deteriorate. At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is\n",

This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons.\n",
       " Description: The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions. Take 10 ml milk sample in sterile MBRT test tube. Add 1 ml MBRT dye solution (dye concentration 0.005%). Stopper the tubes with sterilized rubber stopper and carefully place them in a test tube stand dipped in a serological water bath maintained at 37t1oC. Record this time as the beginning of the incubation period. Decolourization is considered complete when only a faint blue ring (about 5mm) persists at the top. However, for processed dairy products, the enumeration of bacterial load is time-consuming and requires different methods.\n",
       " Expected solution: The above mentioned MBRT takes 4 to 6 Hours for completion of the test. Therefore, it is proposed to develop cost effective, rapid and portable method/Machine to deduct microbial load in Raw and Pasteurized Milk as compared to present Methylene blue reduction test (MBRT).Meanwhile, smart packaging tools such as freshness indicators could be a solution for processed dairy products.ln this context, artificial intelligence, machine vision, systems, etc. could be explored.</div>\n",

For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985.\n",

Due to low levels of water metering in irrigation, it is challenging to control theft from canals and unauthorized ground water extractions. Therefore, ET based technologies can enforce water accounting / auditing and thus enhance Water Use Efficiency (WUE). \n",
       " However, the EOS based ET technology has certain limitations i.e. low accuracy under cloudy conditions and low resolutions. Therefore, the drone-based ET systems can be used to bridge this data gap. \n",
       " Description: The idea is to estimate the actual water consumption by the crops (i.e. AET) in a targeted irrigated command area (ranging from 50 Ha to 5000 Ha) with the help of a drone based system. This system should have a portable drone control module along with an in-built Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&amp;ML) mechanism to work out AET and calibrate against the satellite-based ET inputs. Once integrated with cadastral maps, it should be tailored for individual farm level water control. \n",
       " Expected Solution: A drone fitted with suitable ET sensing system to bridge the data gaps/limitations from Satellite based ET system for calculation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of different crops under survey. The AI&amp;ML algorithm using historical data and satellite based inputs should be able to give various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at farm level like (i) Type of Crop; (ii) Crop monitoring (seeding/sowing/harvest/ disease etc); (iii) Water Auditing/Water Accounting: (iv) Over irrigated vs under irrigated/Ground water use; etc. \n",
       " These KPI's can provide an insight of farmer irrigation decision-making; estimation of irrigation water use; farmer irrigation behavior heuristics and management practices, including the scheduling and efficiency of irrigation decisions. The software model can be polished over time in different irrigation commands to improve the accuracy and reliability of irrigation water use estimation. This will give a complete control of water use and agriculture productivity at field through remote sensing and help in increasing the Groundwater Level in critical unsafe areas.</div>\n",

This variability can strain the power grid, leading to inefficiencies and reliability issues. Traditional grid infrastructure is not designed to handle these fluctuations effectively, resulting in energy wastage and a reliance on fossil fuel-based backup power.

       " Coal is the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India. It accounts for 55% of the country's energy need. The country's industrial heritage was built upon indigenous coal. Our countries major production of Electricity is achieved through coal fired thermal power plant which is around 3/4th of the total power generation and also the biggest source of Carbon emission. India updated its NDC according to which the target: To reduce emissions intensity of its GDP has been enhanced to 45% by 2030 from 2005 level. India's also creating energy transition pathway to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to reduce the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. However, owning to energy security issue the role of coal cannot be ruled out in immediate future till various storage solution gets mature and become available at affordable cost.\n",

       " Description:\n",
       " Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is a promising technology that can help India meet its energy security and emission reduction goals. CCUS can be retrofitted to existing power and industrial plants, allowing for their continued operation. CCS was acknowledged as a solution for climate mitigation by IPCC. However, IPCC also noted that CCS has the highest cost and lowest possible contribution to net emission reduction in both energy and industry sectors. This problem is having potential opportunity for innovators, researchers and start-ups. In order to meet the 1.5°C goal, IPCC projects the need to have technical geological storage of about 1,000 GtCO2. However, the availability of geological storage is highly location dependent and there are several technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-cultural barriers to implementing CCS, according to IPCC.\n",

The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.\n",
       " Detailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example:\n",
       " 60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam\n",
       " 40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam\n",
       " 30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam.\n",
       " Since January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student’s responses. Also some of the people are misusing the benefits by training or teaching the scribe rather than the child with SLD to write the exam and score good marks.\n",

One of the major reasons for disability among the elderly people is falls. Every year, one-third of community-dwelling older adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall. Falls, defined as “unexpected event[s] in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level,” are responsible for a wide range of negative health outcomes. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults, and the age-adjusted fall death rate (64 deaths per 100,000 older adults) increased by 30%. Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause older adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of falling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect whereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their everyday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and more susceptible to future falls. In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual’s strength, balance, and mobility\n",
       " Description: Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants’ presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more\n",
       " The recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people.\n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " These technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers</div>\n",

These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class.\n",
       " Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately.\n",
       " Detailed Description:\n",
       " Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler’s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis.\n",
       " A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification.\n",

       " Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird\n",

       " The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand.\n",
       " Description:\n",
       " The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs.\n",
       " Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive.\n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.</div>\n",

       " 1. Attendance Automation:\n",
       " Use facial recognition algorithms or mobile app-based check-ins to automatically record student attendance.\n",
       " Generate real-time attendance reports accessible by teachers and administration.\n",
       " 2. Resource Management:\n",
       " Track the usage of classroom resources such as projectors, computers, and other teaching aids through a centralized software platform.\n",
       " Automate the scheduling and maintenance of these resources to minimize downtime.\n",
       " 3. Safety and Security Alerts:\n",
       " Implement software-based alerts for emergencies such as fire, unauthorized access, or other security concerns, integrated with existing security systems.\n",
       " Alert authorities and stakeholders through real-time notifications and reports.\n",
       " 4. Interactive Learning Tools:\n",
       " Integration with existing smart boars and interactive displays to adapt to the teaching content and student needs.\n",
       " Provide real-time feedback and analytics on student engagement and performance.\n",
       " 5. Data Analytics:\n",
       " Collect and analyse data on various classroom activities to provide insights into student behaviour, attendance patterns, and resource utilization.\n",
       " Generate predictive reports to aid in decision-making and improve educational outcomes.\n",
       " AI-based Chabot for helping students to understand their learning gaps.\n",

       " There are numerous engineering and polytechnic institutes in Rajasthan running under the Department of Technical Education, Government of Rajasthan. Notably, during the admission process, there is a significant increase in enquiries from various groups, including students, their parents, and other stakeholders. These enquiries cover a wide range of queries related to admission process, eligibility criteria, information about different colleges, fee structure, curriculum , scholarship , hostel facilities, previous year's college and branch-specific allotments placement opportunities and many more. \n",
       " Currently, stakeholders have tocontact colleges individually through phone or email, and sometimes even visit the colleges personally. This process is not only cumbersome for the stakeholders but also demanding to pool manpower for the colleges to manage these inquiries. \n",
       " Detailed Description: \n",
       " With the continuous rise in enquiries, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the colleges to respond promptly and effectively using traditional communication methods. To address this issue more efficiently and ensure timely assistance for everyone, there is a \n",
       " pressing need to adopt new technological solutions. One effective approach is to develop an \n",
       " AI-powered chatbot at centralized level that would serve as a virtual assistant, available 24/7 to answer a wide range of questions. By automating responses to common enquiries, the chatbot would significantly enhance the accessibility to important information and allow staff to focus on handling more complex queries and other critical tasks. For example, the chatbot would provide insights into information about various engineering and polytechnic colleges that falls under the jurisdiction of Department of Technical Education, and guide users through the admission processes, explain fee structures, share curriculum updates, provide details about available scholarships, share alumni information, and share information on job placement opportunities etc \n",
       " This will empower the technical education department because of the ease of providing information, help and advice instantly to prospective students, their parents, and all interested parties. The required information provided by all colleges can be integrated with ease in software. \n",
       " Expected Solutions: \n",
       " 1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot should rapidly access and provide accurate information from a comprehensive database on topics such as admissions, fees, scholarships, recommendations based on previous years cutoff, minimizing the need for human assistance. Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to support voice based assistance in English languages and can be extended in Hindi and other regional languages ensuring wide accessibility and understanding. \n",
       " 2. Enhanced User Experience: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate easily and find information quickly. The interface should be straightforward, accessible on common platform, and capable of understanding natural language, ensuring user-friendliness. \n",
       " 3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), the chatbot will reduce the workload on department staff, allowing them to concentrate on more complex and urgent tasks. \n",
       " 4. Data Insights: The chatbot will gather valuable data from user interactions, helping the department to identify common concerns and optimize it’s services based on these insights. \n",

       " Despite the thrust on energy transition from fossil fuel sector to a cost-competitive renewable energy sector, Coal will remain pivotal to energy security of the nation in near future. India is targeting for 1.5 Bt coal production by 2030 to cater to the burgeoning energy needs of the country. To achieve the target, improved productivity and safety in coal mining is pivotal.\n",
       " Description:\n",
       " The problem statement is divided into two parts: one is Digital shift handover log system and other is safety management plan as per DGMS guidelines.\n",
       " A digital shift handover log system is a valuable tool for streamlining and improving the transition of responsibilities and information from one shift to the next within an organization.\n",
       " The problem statement envisages that an app based and web based Shift handover log system be developed as per the Statutory and non-statutory log format currently in practice, which is presently being done manually through paper logs. This will ensure sharing of critical information and briefing of the next shift digitally. It will provide supervisors and operators with an immediate, comprehensive overview of the outgoing shift’s activities.\n",
       " Manual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life.\n",
       " Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same.\n",
       " This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine.\n",
       " Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. \n",
       " Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. \n",
       " Possible Solution:\n",
       " An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines.\n",
       " Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.</div>\n",

       " The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further\n",
       " investigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS.\n",
       " Following are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack:\n",
       " 1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range\n",
       " 2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version\n",
       " 3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint\n",
       " 4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)\n",
       " There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also.\n",
       " For the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made:\n",
       " 1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users.\n",
       " 2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability).\n",
       " 3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS).\n",
       " 4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver.\n",
       " 5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure.\n",
       " A solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack.\n",
       " \n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " A set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools\n",
       " should be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack. As high availability is an essential feature, the down time (recovery time) should be minimized to the extent possible.</div>\n",

Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. \n",
       " Detailed description: \n",
       " The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. \n",
       " To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.\n",

       " Expected solution: Automated oil spill detection system for early detection of oil spills\n",
       " A software/tool/system to be developed for detecting oil spills/vessel in distress with suitable methodology that involves programming in python. The tool/system should detect the anomalies in AIS around the vessel. The distress/anomaly zone has to be monitored for oil spills using Satellite datasets. This can help in early detection of oil leak from a ship or vessel. The information can be passed on to the regulatory authorities for quicker and efficient response.</div>\n",

       " INCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis.\n",
       " Detailed Description:\n",
       " Considering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. \n",
       " Data input, classification and arrangement \n",
       " The software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight.\n",
       " Users, Data output and visualization\n",
       " The users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth.\n",
       " -In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence.\n",
       " Data Accessibility\n",
       " The Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data.\n",
       " Expected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.</div>\n",

Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry.\n",
       " Description: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship’s motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters.

However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes.\n",
       " Description: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields.\n",
       " The DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ.\n",
       " If a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes.\n",
       " This system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency.\n",
       " Expected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy. This system has to be applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, government agencies, and more.</div>\n",

It was also accepted that these SDGs are not possible to achieve without changing humanity’s relationship with the oceans. To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade).

The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html.\n",

Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly.\n",

Notable, the PII may be included inadvertently as well. PII, by its nature, is sensitive data, and its exposure must be protected against in order to safeguard users’ privacy. Entities and organizations handling documents or data containing users’ PII must be mindful of the complex challenges that arise with it – they have to balance data storage, encryption, access controls, data retention policies, data management processes with users’ knowledge and consent, notification of breaches by users, grievance redressal, etc. Such an application will aid in alerting individual users to verify whether it is necessary to upload or provide PII-containing document.

       " Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems.\n",
       " The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data.\n",
       " It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice.\n",
       " Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures.\n",

       " 2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs.\n",
       " 2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved.\n",
       " 2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ‘price reasonability’ for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors.\n",
       " 2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking.\n",
       " 2.2 Detailed Description:\n",
       " 2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows:\n",
       " i. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates.\n",
       " ii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price.\n",
       " iii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey.\n",
       " 2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain.\n",
       " 2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach).\n",
       " \n",
       " 2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs.\n",
       " 2.3 Expected Solution:\n",
       " 2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness.\n",

Although these have caught imagination of computer and tech savvy generation, at the same time, these have created concerns because of their ability to disrupt nation’s politics, committing frauds, create dis-information and creating non-consensual contents. Use of Deep fake has also been seen recently to purposefully defame the character of a person in specific. Due to enhancements in AI/ML and Large Language Models for Generative AI, identification and detection of deep fakes have created a huge challenge for Security Agencies. Research on multiple aspects of deep fake identification has been started. As a use case for the problem statement, a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's may be developed.\n",
       " Detailed description: Addressing the deep fake problem requires a multi-pronged approach, combining technology, regulation, education, and collaboration to mitigate the risks and protect individuals and society. However, on the technological front Detecting deep fakes involves development and testing with numerous advanced algorithms and tools. Here are some of the prominent approaches and technologies that can be used in deep fake detection: \n",
       " i.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs can be trained to detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements. CNNs can also analyse video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and discrepancies. \n",
       " ii.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs and LSTMs can be used to analyse the sequence of frames in a video to detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes. \n",
       " iii.Capsule Networks: Capsule networks can identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture. \n",
       " iv.Adversarial Training: Adversarial training involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously training another model to detect them improving the robustness of detection algorithms. \n",
       " v.Audio-Visual Inconsistencies: Combining audio and visual analysis can also help detect deep fakes by identifying mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds. \n",
       " vi.Blockchain Technology: Using blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity. \n",
       " vii.Frequency Analysis: Analysing the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artefacts introduced during the deep fake creation process. \n",
       " viii.Biometric Verification: Analysing subtle behavioural traits such as micro-expressions, eye and head movement to detect anomalies. \n",
       " ix.Hybrid Models: Using a combination of spatial, temporal, audio and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection. \n",
       " Expected solution: A solution based on AI/ML technology may be developed to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. This technique may be based on any of the above-mentioned methods or it may combine multiple methods and demonstrate the final deliverable of detection of deep fakes with accuracy. The input of the system will be a video which is suspected of deep fake and the output should contain detailed report w.r.t various characteristics of deep fake e.g. whether confirmed fake (details of abnormalities observed), mathematical underlying techniques of its creation. \n",

       " Hydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. \n",
       " Description \n",
       " There is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively. \n",
       " Expected Solution \n",
       " There is need to develop a sophisticated model that can incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transient behavior of water within the water conductor system. This model should be able to handle complex scenarios such as sudden load changes, emergency shutdowns, start-up and other operational variations. Provide clear visual representations of pressure fluctuations, flow velocities and potential risk areas. This model should be adaptable to different hydropower and pumped storage systems with varying configurations and operational requirements.</div>\n",

NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies.\n",
       " As pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin.\n",
       " Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological &amp; hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River.\n",
       " Model source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling.\n",
       " The overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems.\n",
       " Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological &amp; hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network.\n",
       " a. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use.\n",
       " b. Dashboard may show the following options \n",
       " i. Ganga River set up a map with options for plotting flow, nitrate, ammonia, phosphorus, DO,BOD,Fecal Coliform and; etc.\n",
       " ii. It may show a time series plot of paramenters such as rainfall, flow, DO, BOD, Fecal Coliform and nitrate for the Ganga River over the past 10 days and a forecast ahead of 3 days.\n",
       " 2. Alrets can be sent out to decision makers providing notice of an extreme event, e.g., pollution discharge, combined sewer pverflows discharges, high pathogen events, or a pulse of high nitrate water moving down the river system.\n",
       " 3. DSS-based post-project monitoring to validate the benefit of government investments.</div>\n",

The Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the SVAMITVA Scheme on the National Panchayati Raj Day, 24th April 2020 with a resolve to enable the economic progress of Rural India by providing “Record of Rights” to every rural household owner. The scheme aims to demarcate inhabited (Abadi) land in rural areas through the latest surveying drone technology, Continuous Operating Reference System (CORS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization of properties and enabling bank loan; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning\n",
       " 2. With the use latest drone technology and CORS technology for the Abadi land survey, the high resolution and accurate image base maps of 50 cm have facilitated creation of the most durable record of property holdings in these areas with no legacy revenue records.

       " In a SCADA system, for a pipeline network spanning thousands of kilometres, the network devices (both layer 2 and layer 3) are spread all along the geographical area. With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network.\n",
       " Problem Statement Details:\n",
       " “Develop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.”\n",

Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun’s trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and Simulink®, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using Simulink® Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.\n",

SAR image colorization using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data. The project aims to develop an innovative solution to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced interpretation and analysis of feature targets. A novel DL model needs to be designed and trained using pairs of SAR and Optical images, minimizing a loss function that captures the difference between predicted and actual color images. The participants are challenged to create a DL system that can accurately predict and apply colors to SAR images, making surface features more distinguishable and interpretable.\n",

The satellite data from Indian Satellites such as Cartosat-2/3 and Cartosat-1 are capable of generating 3D city models up to LoD-1. These LoD1 models, which are derived by extruding a footprint to a uniform height, can be used for simulating building shadows. This project aims to develop an interactive application for assessing BIPV potential using LOD-1 3D city model.

The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases where a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial insight into the stability and security of the software. The process of fuzzing can be divided into following broad steps –\n",
       " 1. Identification of Target Function(s) – Target function(s) are typically those functions that act as entry points for processing input data. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data.\n",
       " 2. Developing harness – Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole purpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A harness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how the target application receives and processes the input.\n",

       " <div class=\"style-2\" style=\"overflow-y: auto; min-height:20px; max-height: 200px; width:100%;\"> Background : Digital evidence has become increasingly crucial in forensic investigations. The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery.\n",
       " Forensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence.\n",
       " Detailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data.\n",
       " Moreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms.\n",
       " Expected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to:\n",
       " 1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data structures of XFS and Btrfs.\n",
       " 2. Support a wide range of file types: Recover Text-Based Document Formats(doc,docx, rtf, pdf, txt, odt, html, xml, ppt, odp, xls, ods, log, csv, tsv, txt, conf, ini, cfg etc), archives file(zip, tar, rar, iso, rpm, deb etc), Image-Based Document Formats(jpg, jpeg, png, gif, tif etc), executables binaries(.elf, .so, .a, exe, dll, bat, cmd) scripts files(ps, ps1, sh, bash, zsh, py etc), database file(.db etc) and other relevant data formats.\n",
       " 3. Extract complete metadata: Recover accurate creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, file names, and other essential metadata associated with deleted files.\n",
       " 4. Provide user-friendly interface: Offer an intuitive interface (GUI/CLI) for easily navigate recovered data and generate reports.\n",
       " 5. Ensure data integrity: Implement robust data validation and verification mechanisms to maintain the integrity of recovered data.</div>\n",

       " Two aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine – The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important.\n",
       " TKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour\n",
       " It is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation.\n",
       " TKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour)\n",
       " Where, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift.\n",
       " Assessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory.\n",
       " More is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must.\n",
       " Actions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL’s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle’s Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition.\n",
       " Tyre Pressure\n",
       " Proper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources.\n",
       " Expected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime.\n",
       " Tyre Performance Analysis\n",
       " Apart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres.\n",
       " Such analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.</div>\n",

       " Milk is perishable product, it requires immediate processing after few hours (2-4Hrs) of production, otherwise, bacterial load increases and milk gets deteriorate. At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is\n",

This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons.\n",
       " Description: The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions. Take 10 ml milk sample in sterile MBRT test tube. Add 1 ml MBRT dye solution (dye concentration 0.005%). Stopper the tubes with sterilized rubber stopper and carefully place them in a test tube stand dipped in a serological water bath maintained at 37t1oC. Record this time as the beginning of the incubation period. Decolourization is considered complete when only a faint blue ring (about 5mm) persists at the top. However, for processed dairy products, the enumeration of bacterial load is time-consuming and requires different methods.\n",
       " Expected solution: The above mentioned MBRT takes 4 to 6 Hours for completion of the test. Therefore, it is proposed to develop cost effective, rapid and portable method/Machine to deduct microbial load in Raw and Pasteurized Milk as compared to present Methylene blue reduction test (MBRT).Meanwhile, smart packaging tools such as freshness indicators could be a solution for processed dairy products.ln this context, artificial intelligence, machine vision, systems, etc. could be explored.</div>\n",

For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985.\n",

Due to low levels of water metering in irrigation, it is challenging to control theft from canals and unauthorized ground water extractions. Therefore, ET based technologies can enforce water accounting / auditing and thus enhance Water Use Efficiency (WUE). \n",
       " However, the EOS based ET technology has certain limitations i.e. low accuracy under cloudy conditions and low resolutions. Therefore, the drone-based ET systems can be used to bridge this data gap. \n",
       " Description: The idea is to estimate the actual water consumption by the crops (i.e. AET) in a targeted irrigated command area (ranging from 50 Ha to 5000 Ha) with the help of a drone based system. This system should have a portable drone control module along with an in-built Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&amp;ML) mechanism to work out AET and calibrate against the satellite-based ET inputs. Once integrated with cadastral maps, it should be tailored for individual farm level water control. \n",
       " Expected Solution: A drone fitted with suitable ET sensing system to bridge the data gaps/limitations from Satellite based ET system for calculation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of different crops under survey. The AI&amp;ML algorithm using historical data and satellite based inputs should be able to give various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at farm level like (i) Type of Crop; (ii) Crop monitoring (seeding/sowing/harvest/ disease etc); (iii) Water Auditing/Water Accounting: (iv) Over irrigated vs under irrigated/Ground water use; etc. \n",
       " These KPI's can provide an insight of farmer irrigation decision-making; estimation of irrigation water use; farmer irrigation behavior heuristics and management practices, including the scheduling and efficiency of irrigation decisions. The software model can be polished over time in different irrigation commands to improve the accuracy and reliability of irrigation water use estimation. This will give a complete control of water use and agriculture productivity at field through remote sensing and help in increasing the Groundwater Level in critical unsafe areas.</div>\n",

This variability can strain the power grid, leading to inefficiencies and reliability issues. Traditional grid infrastructure is not designed to handle these fluctuations effectively, resulting in energy wastage and a reliance on fossil fuel-based backup power.

       " Coal is the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India. It accounts for 55% of the country's energy need. The country's industrial heritage was built upon indigenous coal. Our countries major production of Electricity is achieved through coal fired thermal power plant which is around 3/4th of the total power generation and also the biggest source of Carbon emission. India updated its NDC according to which the target: To reduce emissions intensity of its GDP has been enhanced to 45% by 2030 from 2005 level. India's also creating energy transition pathway to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to reduce the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. However, owning to energy security issue the role of coal cannot be ruled out in immediate future till various storage solution gets mature and become available at affordable cost.\n",

       " Description:\n",
       " Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is a promising technology that can help India meet its energy security and emission reduction goals. CCUS can be retrofitted to existing power and industrial plants, allowing for their continued operation. CCS was acknowledged as a solution for climate mitigation by IPCC. However, IPCC also noted that CCS has the highest cost and lowest possible contribution to net emission reduction in both energy and industry sectors. This problem is having potential opportunity for innovators, researchers and start-ups. In order to meet the 1.5°C goal, IPCC projects the need to have technical geological storage of about 1,000 GtCO2. However, the availability of geological storage is highly location dependent and there are several technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-cultural barriers to implementing CCS, according to IPCC.\n",

The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.\n",
       " Detailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example:\n",
       " 60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam\n",
       " 40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam\n",
       " 30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam.\n",
       " Since January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student’s responses. Also some of the people are misusing the benefits by training or teaching the scribe rather than the child with SLD to write the exam and score good marks.\n",

One of the major reasons for disability among the elderly people is falls. Every year, one-third of community-dwelling older adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall. Falls, defined as “unexpected event[s] in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level,” are responsible for a wide range of negative health outcomes. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults, and the age-adjusted fall death rate (64 deaths per 100,000 older adults) increased by 30%. Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause older adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of falling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect whereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their everyday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and more susceptible to future falls. In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual’s strength, balance, and mobility\n",
       " Description: Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants’ presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more\n",
       " The recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people.\n",
       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " These technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers</div>\n",

These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class.\n",
       " Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately.\n",
       " Detailed Description:\n",
       " Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler’s, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis.\n",
       " A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification.\n",

       " The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand.\n",
       " Description:\n",
       " The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs.\n",
       " Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive.\n",

       " An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.</div>\n",

       " There are numerous engineering and polytechnic institutes in Rajasthan running under the Department of Technical Education, Government of Rajasthan. Notably, during the admission process, there is a significant increase in enquiries from various groups, including students, their parents, and other stakeholders. These enquiries cover a wide range of queries related to admission process, eligibility criteria, information about different colleges, fee structure, curriculum , scholarship , hostel facilities, previous year's college and branch-specific allotments placement opportunities and many more. \n",
       " Currently, stakeholders have tocontact colleges individually through phone or email, and sometimes even visit the colleges personally. This process is not only cumbersome for the stakeholders but also demanding to pool manpower for the colleges to manage these inquiries. \n",
       " Detailed Description: \n",
       " With the continuous rise in enquiries, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the colleges to respond promptly and effectively using traditional communication methods. To address this issue more efficiently and ensure timely assistance for everyone, there is a \n",
       " pressing need to adopt new technological solutions. One effective approach is to develop an \n",
       " AI-powered chatbot at centralized level that would serve as a virtual assistant, available 24/7 to answer a wide range of questions. By automating responses to common enquiries, the chatbot would significantly enhance the accessibility to important information and allow staff to focus on handling more complex queries and other critical tasks. For example, the chatbot would provide insights into information about various engineering and polytechnic colleges that falls under the jurisdiction of Department of Technical Education, and guide users through the admission processes, explain fee structures, share curriculum updates, provide details about available scholarships, share alumni information, and share information on job placement opportunities etc \n",
       " This will empower the technical education department because of the ease of providing information, help and advice instantly to prospective students, their parents, and all interested parties. The required information provided by all colleges can be integrated with ease in software. \n",
       " Expected Solutions: \n",
       " 1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot should rapidly access and provide accurate information from a comprehensive database on topics such as admissions, fees, scholarships, recommendations based on previous years cutoff, minimizing the need for human assistance. Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to support voice based assistance in English languages and can be extended in Hindi and other regional languages ensuring wide accessibility and understanding. \n",
       " 2. Enhanced User Experience: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate easily and find information quickly. The interface should be straightforward, accessible on common platform, and capable of understanding natural language, ensuring user-friendliness. \n",
       " 3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), the chatbot will reduce the workload on department staff, allowing them to concentrate on more complex and urgent tasks. \n",
       " 4. Data Insights: The chatbot will gather valuable data from user interactions, helping the department to identify common concerns and optimize it’s services based on these insights. \n",

       " Despite the thrust on energy transition from fossil fuel sector to a cost-competitive renewable energy sector, Coal will remain pivotal to energy security of the nation in near future. India is targeting for 1.5 Bt coal production by 2030 to cater to the burgeoning energy needs of the country. To achieve the target, improved productivity and safety in coal mining is pivotal.\n",
       " Description:\n",
       " The problem statement is divided into two parts: one is Digital shift handover log system and other is safety management plan as per DGMS guidelines.\n",
       " A digital shift handover log system is a valuable tool for streamlining and improving the transition of responsibilities and information from one shift to the next within an organization.\n",
       " The problem statement envisages that an app based and web based Shift handover log system be developed as per the Statutory and non-statutory log format currently in practice, which is presently being done manually through paper logs. This will ensure sharing of critical information and briefing of the next shift digitally. It will provide supervisors and operators with an immediate, comprehensive overview of the outgoing shift’s activities.\n",
       " Manual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life.\n",
       " Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same.\n",
       " This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine.\n",
       " Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. \n",
       " Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. \n",
       " Possible Solution:\n",
       " An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines.\n",
       " Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.</div>\n",

This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. \n",
       " Detailed description: \n",
       " The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. \n",
       " To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.\n",
       " Option 1 : off Mumbai: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HUisEfMA20ilODdeoRYVneG2i1ZbRBNB/view?usp=drive_link\n",
       " Option 2 :Gulf of Mexico – North American waters: \n",
       " https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_iEcojaZNaezOqKwxHtCenjgOW58lPgA/view?usp=drive_link\n",
       " Expected solution: Automated oil spill detection system for early detection of oil spills\n",
       " A software/tool/system to be developed for detecting oil spills/vessel in distress with suitable methodology that involves programming in python. The tool/system should detect the anomalies in AIS around the vessel. The distress/anomaly zone has to be monitored for oil spills using Satellite datasets. This can help in early detection of oil leak from a ship or vessel. The information can be passed on to the regulatory authorities for quicker and efficient response.</div>\n",

       " INCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis.\n",
       " Detailed Description:\n",
       " Considering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. \n",
       " Data input, classification and arrangement \n",
       " The software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight.\n",
       " Users, Data output and visualization\n",
       " The users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth.\n",
       " -In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence.\n",
       " Data Accessibility\n",
       " The Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data.\n",
       " Expected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.</div>\n",

Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry.\n",
       " Description: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship’s motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters.

However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes.\n",
       " Description: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields.\n",
       " The DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ.\n",
       " If a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes.\n",
       " This system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency.\n",
       " Expected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy.

It was also accepted that these SDGs are not possible to achieve without changing humanity’s relationship with the oceans. To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/).\n",

       " Description: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html.\n",

       " Expected Solution:\n",
       " The user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly.\n",

Users of these digital facilities are required to upload government-issued containing documents or provide data for successfully availing the services. However, the uploaded documents or data which are required to facilitate these digital services and processes contain personally identifiable information (PII), i.e. any data that can be used to identify an individual uniquely. These documents can be like Aadhaar card, PAN, Credit Card, Driving License etc and can include data like names, address, phone number, email address, and financial information, among others of the user. The handling of PII is crucial as its exposure can lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, and financial fraud among other cyber related issues.\n",

Notable, the PII may be included inadvertently as well. PII, by its nature, is sensitive data, and its exposure must be protected against in order to safeguard users’ privacy. Entities and organizations handling documents or data containing users’ PII must be mindful of the complex challenges that arise with it – they have to balance data storage, encryption, access controls, data retention policies, data management processes with users’ knowledge and consent, notification of breaches by users, grievance redressal, etc. Such an application will aid in alerting individual users to verify whether it is necessary to upload or provide PII-containing document.

       " Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems.\n",
       " The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data.\n",
       " It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice.\n",
       " Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures.\n",

       " 2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs.\n",
       " 2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved.\n",
       " 2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ‘price reasonability’ for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors.\n",
       " 2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking.\n",
       " 2.2 Detailed Description:\n",
       " 2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows:\n",
       " i. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates.\n",
       " ii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price.\n",
       " iii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey.\n",
       " 2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain.\n",
       " 2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach).\n",
       " \n",
       " 2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs.\n",
       " 2.3 Expected Solution:\n",
       " 2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness.\n",
       " 2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services.\n",
       " 2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user. The minimum input fields and the expected output fields are explained below, for various scenarios.\n",

Although these have caught imagination of computer and tech savvy generation, at the same time, these have created concerns because of their ability to disrupt nation’s politics, committing frauds, create dis-information and creating non-consensual contents. Use of Deep fake has also been seen recently to purposefully defame the character of a person in specific. Due to enhancements in AI/ML and Large Language Models for Generative AI, identification and detection of deep fakes have created a huge challenge for Security Agencies. Research on multiple aspects of deep fake identification has been started. As a use case for the problem statement, a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's may be developed.\n",
       " Detailed description: Addressing the deep fake problem requires a multi-pronged approach, combining technology, regulation, education, and collaboration to mitigate the risks and protect individuals and society. However, on the technological front Detecting deep fakes involves development and testing with numerous advanced algorithms and tools. Here are some of the prominent approaches and technologies that can be used in deep fake detection: \n",
       " i.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs can be trained to detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements. CNNs can also analyse video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and discrepancies. \n",
       " ii.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs and LSTMs can be used to analyse the sequence of frames in a video to detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes. \n",
       " iii.Capsule Networks: Capsule networks can identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture. \n",
       " iv.Adversarial Training: Adversarial training involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously training another model to detect them improving the robustness of detection algorithms. \n",
       " v.Audio-Visual Inconsistencies: Combining audio and visual analysis can also help detect deep fakes by identifying mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds. \n",
       " vi.Blockchain Technology: Using blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity. \n",
       " vii.Frequency Analysis: Analysing the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artefacts introduced during the deep fake creation process. \n",
       " viii.Biometric Verification: Analysing subtle behavioural traits such as micro-expressions, eye and head movement to detect anomalies. \n",
       " ix.Hybrid Models: Using a combination of spatial, temporal, audio and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection. \n",
       " Expected solution: A solution based on AI/ML technology may be developed to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. This technique may be based on any of the above-mentioned methods or it may combine multiple methods and demonstrate the final deliverable of detection of deep fakes with accuracy. The input of the system will be a video which is suspected of deep fake and the output should contain detailed report w.r.t various characteristics of deep fake e.g. whether confirmed fake (details of abnormalities observed), mathematical underlying techniques of its creation. \n",

       " Hydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. \n",
       " Description \n",
       " There is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively. \n",
       " Expected Solution \n",
       " There is need to develop a sophisticated model that can incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transient behavior of water within the water conductor system. This model should be able to handle complex scenarios such as sudden load changes, emergency shutdowns, start-up and other operational variations. Provide clear visual representations of pressure fluctuations, flow velocities and potential risk areas. This model should be adaptable to different hydropower and pumped storage systems with varying configurations and operational requirements.</div>\n",

NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies.\n",
       " As pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin.\n",
       " Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological &amp; hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River.\n",
       " Model source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling.\n",
       " The overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems.\n",
       " Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological &amp; hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network.\n",
       " a. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use.\n",
       " b. Dashboard may show the following options \n",
       " i. Ganga River set up a map with options for plotting flow, nitrate, ammonia, phosphorus, DO,BOD,Fecal Coliform and; etc.\n",
       " ii. It may show a time series plot of paramenters such as rainfall, flow, DO, BOD, Fecal Coliform and nitrate for the Ganga River over the past 10 days and a forecast ahead of 3 days.\n",
       " 2. Alrets can be sent out to decision makers providing notice of an extreme event, e.g., pollution discharge, combined sewer pverflows discharges, high pathogen events, or a pulse of high nitrate water moving down the river system.\n",
       " 3. DSS-based post-project monitoring to validate the benefit of government investments.</div>\n",

The Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the SVAMITVA Scheme on the National Panchayati Raj Day, 24th April 2020 with a resolve to enable the economic progress of Rural India by providing “Record of Rights” to every rural household owner. The scheme aims to demarcate inhabited (Abadi) land in rural areas through the latest surveying drone technology, Continuous Operating Reference System (CORS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization of properties and enabling bank loan; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning\n",
       " 2. With the use latest drone technology and CORS technology for the Abadi land survey, the high resolution and accurate image base maps of 50 cm have facilitated creation of the most durable record of property holdings in these areas with no legacy revenue records. Such accurate image-based maps provide a clear demarcation of land holdings in a very short frame of time compared to on ground physical measurement and mapping of the land parcels.\n",

       " In a SCADA system, for a pipeline network spanning thousands of kilometres, the network devices (both layer 2 and layer 3) are spread all along the geographical area. With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network.\n",
       " Problem Statement Details:\n",
       " “Develop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.”\n",

Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun’s trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and Simulink®, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using Simulink® Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.\n",

SAR image colorization using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data. The project aims to develop an innovative solution to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced interpretation and analysis of feature targets. A novel DL model needs to be designed and trained using pairs of SAR and Optical images, minimizing a loss function that captures the difference between predicted and actual color images. The participants are challenged to create a DL system that can accurately predict and apply colors to SAR images, making surface features more distinguishable and interpretable.\n",

The satellite data from Indian Satellites such as Cartosat-2/3 and Cartosat-1 are capable of generating 3D city models up to LoD-1. These LoD1 models, which are derived by extruding a footprint to a uniform height, can be used for simulating building shadows. This project aims to develop an interactive application for assessing BIPV potential using LOD-1 3D city model.

The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases where a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial insight into the stability and security of the software. The process of fuzzing can be divided into following broad steps –\n",
       " 1. Identification of Target Function(s) – Target function(s) are typically those functions that act as entry points for processing input data. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data.\n",
       " 2. Developing harness – Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole purpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A harness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how the target application receives and processes the input.\n",

       " <div class=\"style-2\" style=\"overflow-y: auto; min-height:20px; max-height: 200px; width:100%;\"> Background : Digital evidence has become increasingly crucial in forensic investigations. The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery.\n",
       " Forensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence.\n",
       " Detailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data.\n",
       " Moreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms.\n",
       " Expected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to:\n",
       " 1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data structures of XFS and Btrfs.\n",
       " 2. Support a wide range of file types: Recover Text-Based Document Formats(doc,docx, rtf, pdf, txt, odt, html, xml, ppt, odp, xls, ods, log, csv, tsv, txt, conf, ini, cfg etc), archives file(zip, tar, rar, iso, rpm, deb etc), Image-Based Document Formats(jpg, jpeg, png, gif, tif etc), executables binaries(.elf, .so, .a, exe, dll, bat, cmd) scripts files(ps, ps1, sh, bash, zsh, py etc), database file(.db etc) and other relevant data formats.\n",
       " 3. Extract complete metadata: Recover accurate creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, file names, and other essential metadata associated with deleted files.\n",
       " 4. Provide user-friendly interface: Offer an intuitive interface (GUI/CLI) for easily navigate recovered data and generate reports.\n",
       " 5. Ensure data integrity: Implement robust data validation and verification mechanisms to maintain the integrity of recovered data.</div>\n",
